# Project Memory

This is your **knowledge management system** - where all completed work and ongoing project tracking lives.

## Purpose

- Store completed projects for future reference
- Track ongoing work via Active Projects Index
- Enable pattern recognition across all business activities
- Support strategic alignment validation
- Compound knowledge systematically

## Folder Structure

### Content Projects/
Completed content deliverables:
- YouTube videos (scripts, outlines, research)
- Blog posts
- Social media campaigns
- Newsletters

**File naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_content-type_descriptive-title.md`

### Product Builds/
Completed product builds:
- Custom GPTs
- Tools and automation
- Courses and programs
- Templates and frameworks

**File naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_product-type_descriptive-title.md`

### Strategic Planning/
Business strategy documents:
- Quarterly plans
- Annual reviews
- Strategic pivots
- Major decisions

**File naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_weekly-plan.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD_quarterly-plan.md`

### Daily Planning/
Daily execution roadmaps generated by Claude Code.

**Auto-generated**: Claude creates these when you ask "Generate daily roadmap"

**File naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_daily-roadmap.md`

### Productivity Tracking/
Daily and weekly productivity assessments.

**Auto-generated**: Claude creates these when you ask "Assess my productivity today"

**File naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD_daily-assessment.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD_weekly-assessment.md`

### Active Projects Index/
Lightweight indices for all ongoing work in `Active Projects/` folder.

**Auto-generated**: Claude syncs these when you ask "Sync all project indices"

**File naming**: `[project-name]-index.md`

### _Templates/
Example project files showing proper metadata structure.

Use these as starting points when creating new projects manually.

## How to Use

### Create New Project

Ask Claude:
```
"Create new project for [description]"
```

Claude will:
- Determine appropriate category
- Create file with YAML metadata
- Add strategic alignment scores
- Link to related projects
- Save to correct folder

### Search Projects

Ask Claude:
```
"Find projects about [topic]"
"Show me all content projects from last quarter"
"What have I done on [subject]?"
```

### Reference Past Work

When starting new work:
```
"What similar projects have I done before?"
"Show me reusable components from [past project]"
```

## Metadata Schema

Every project file includes YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
project_id: "uuid"
title: "Project title"
project_type: "content|product|strategy|marketing|community|research"
status: "planning|in-progress|paused|completed|archived"
date_created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
date_modified: "YYYY-MM-DD"

strategic_alignment:
  oobg_relevance: 0-100
  unique_vehicle_fit: 0-100
  avatar_targets: ["avatar-name"]

business_metrics:
  expected_outcome: "description"
  actual_outcome: "description"
  roi_estimate: "value"

tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
related_projects: ["project-id"]
knowledge_base_refs: ["AI-Growth-Engine-file.md"]
---
```

## Best Practices

1. **Complete metadata**: Don't skip YAML frontmatter (enables search)
2. **Strategic scores**: Rate OOBG relevance honestly (enables pattern recognition)
3. **Tag generously**: More tags = better searchability
4. **Link related work**: Cross-reference similar projects
5. **Document outcomes**: Record actual results (learn what works)
