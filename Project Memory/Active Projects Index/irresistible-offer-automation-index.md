## Current Status

**Phase**: Research & Analysis (10% complete)
**Priority**: HIGH (critical for business scalability)

**Project Type**: Process Automation (AI-powered)
- Purpose: Automate Bill Baren's irresistible offer creation for Sales Accelerator
- Current: Bill creates offers live in 45-minute calls (bottleneck)
- Target: Strategist interview → AI generates 90% complete offer → Bill reviews (QC only)
- Goal: Free Bill from creation, enable 10x volume, maintain quality

**Core Challenge**: Capture Bill's genius for creating irresistible offers (systematic framework + judgment/taste) and automate it while preserving quality

## Bill's Irresistible Offer Framework

**10 Core Components**:
1. Strategy - One star result with supporting cast
2. Audience - Concrete "who" with disqualifiers
3. Format - Tangible container (time + delivery + service type)
4. Positioning - One-sentence core (destination + vehicle)
5. Naming - Short (2-3 words), result-oriented, compelling, clear
6. Product Journey - 3-5 steps, reframed as promises
7. Bonuses - Objection-killing stack with Decision Maker Bonus
8. Pricing - Retail + promo, installment math
9. Sales Boosters - Conversion elements
10. Guarantee - Risk reversal matched to confidence

**Key Principles**:
- One star of the show (ruthless editing)
- Client-centric language (buyer sees themselves)
- Tangibility (make intangible feel like a "thing")
- Hot open (2-3 sentences: result + time + guarantee)

## Last Activity

**2025-11-19**: Project created and research phase completed
- Created project structure (CLAUDE.md, README.md, folder structure)
- Reviewed comprehensive research:
  - The Ultimate Guide to Crafting an Irresistible Offer (34K word manual)
  - Sales Accelerator Intake Questions (current baseline)
  - 3 interview transcripts (Bill explaining his process)
- Extracted Bill's decision patterns and framework
- Documented 6 key deliverables

**Next Session**: Begin strategist interview guide design (map Bill's mental model → explicit questions)

## Strategic Context

**Why This Matters**:
Bill Baren is the partner who creates offers in Sales Accelerator. His gift for crafting irresistible offers is a competitive advantage - but it's also a bottleneck limiting growth.

**The Opportunity**:
Bill's methodology is systematic (10-component framework with explicit rules). The "magic" is applying the framework with judgment. By capturing this, we can automate 90% while preserving quality.

**Business Impact**:
- **Strategic Alignment**: 95/100 OOBG relevance
- **Bill's Time**: Freed from creation (shift to QC only)
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x volume
- **Quality**: Maintained or improved through systematic process

**Two-Stage AI System**:
1. Offer Generation Prompt (questionnaire + interview → complete offer)
2. Quality Control Prompt (separate pass to check & improve)

**Success Metrics**:
- AI generates 90%+ complete offers
- Bill's review time <15 min (vs. 45 min creation)
- Strategist executes interview independently
- Offer quality matches or exceeds Bill's standard
