## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Lead Gen Jay's cold email approach is built on a counterintuitive principle: **cold emails are not about selling—they're about identifying if a problem exists**. After 10+ years and hundreds of campaigns across diverse industries (from gold bars to dirty maid services to IT consulting), Jay has developed a systematic framework that consistently achieves 5-20% reply rates and 2%+ opportunity rates.

The core insight: People don't want to be sold to via email. They want to feel like the email could be from a colleague, vendor, or client. The moment they detect a sales pitch before opening, you're dead. Jay's "Triple Tap" framework—getting the open, getting them to read, and getting action—ensures every element of the email serves a specific behavioral purpose.

This is not traditional copywriting. Using the wrong word doesn't just lose the sale—it sends you to spam. This report distills Jay's complete methodology into actionable principles, tactical frameworks, and specific copy techniques.

## I. CORE PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH

### A. The Fundamental Mindset Shift

**Traditional Copywriting vs. Cold Email Copywriting**

Most people approach cold email with a traditional copywriting mindset: persuade, overcome objections, close the sale. This is fatal. In cold email:

- **Your goal is NOT to sell** → Your goal is to identify if they have a problem you can solve
- **They don't know you** → They have zero trust baseline
- **They don't trust you** → Any claim will be met with skepticism
- **They're not looking for your solution** → You're interrupting their day
- **You have seconds, not minutes** → Attention span is brutal

**The "Email to a Friend" Principle**

Jay's golden rule: "It should sound like an email to a friend, not a sales pitch."

Before they open your email, they should NOT know:
- That you're selling something
- That this is a cold email
- That you're a stranger

It should sound like it could be:
- A colleague asking a question
- A vendor following up on something
- A client or partner with a concern
- Someone they met at a conference

The moment they smell "sales pitch" in the preview text, you're marked as spam.

**The "Raise Their Hand" Strategy**

Your singular goal: Get them to raise their hand and say "I'm interested."

That's it. You're not:
- Explaining your entire service
- Overcoming all objections
- Closing them on a call
- Convincing them they have a problem

You're simply asking: "Do you have this problem? If so, reply 'yes' and I'll send more info."

If they reply "yes," NOW you have a qualified lead who has self-identified. The sales process can begin.

### B. The Triple Tap Framework

Jay breaks every cold email into three distinct actions the prospect must take. Each action has specific copy requirements.

#### **TAP 1: GETTING THE OPEN (Preview Text)**

**What They See Before Opening:**
- Sender name
- Subject line (bold text)
- First sentence of email (preview text)

**Goal:** Make them click to open the email.

**How Preview Text Works:**

The preview text is the first sentence of your email that appears in their inbox preview. This is your ONLY chance to get the open.

**The Open Paradox:**

You might think: "I'll just use a shocking subject line to get opens!"

Example: "Your house is on fire" or "I've taken your mother"

Yes, they'll open it. But then they'll immediately see it's a sales pitch and report you as spam. Open rate ≠ success. You need opens that lead to READS.

**Preview Text Rules:**

1. **Never signal the sale** - If they know you're selling before they open, they won't open
2. **Related to email body** - Can't completely bait and switch (leads to spam reports)
3. **Questions get opens** - Human nature: we want to answer questions
4. **Pattern interrupt** - Break their expectations of what a cold email looks like

**Examples of Good Preview Text:**

Instead of:
- ❌ "Hey [name], what if I could get you more leads?"
- ❌ "Are you interested in cold email services?"
- ❌ "I can help you grow your business"

Use:
- ✅ "Not sure if you're sending these or not, [name]" (Subject: "sending cold emails?")
- ✅ "Just came across this on Google. Can you confirm this is you or not?" (Subject: "you on Google")
- ✅ "Does this sound familiar?" (Subject: "question [name]")

**The Question Technique:**

Questions are one of the oldest and most effective subject line/preview text techniques:

- "Question [name]?" → Simple, direct, could be from anyone
- "Did your patient ask for RPM?" → Sounds internal/colleague
- "Do you follow [competitor]?" → Curiosity-driven

**Pattern Interrupt Strategy:**

Most cold emails start with: "Hey [firstname]"

Everyone knows this pattern. It screams "cold email."

**Alternative approach:**
- "What do you think about this book title I came up with for you, Sarah?" (Name comes after the hook)
- "I heard you were thinking about writing a book" (No greeting at all)
- "Just making sure this is [firstName]" (Implies existing relationship)

#### **TAP 2: GETTING THEM TO READ (Email Body)**

**Once They Open:**

Now they're reading. You have maybe 5-10 seconds before they:
- Trash it
- Report it as spam
- Close it and forget it

**Your Two Goals in the Email Body:**

1. **Call out their problem + how you solve it** (the mechanism)
2. **Build trust and credibility** (authentic social proof)

**Length Requirement:**

2-3 sentences. That's it. If you need more than that, your offer is too complicated for cold email.

**Reading Level:**

6th grade. If you confuse your prospect, you lose your prospect.

Test your copy through an AI or readability tool. If it's above 6th grade level, simplify it.

**Problem + Solution Format:**

You need to accomplish both in your body:

**Example 1 (PR Services):**
"I'm running the outbound marketing for Lead Gen Jay after seeing their pretty crazy success. I was hoping I could do the same for you. Here's an article that USA Today wrote about my methods."

- Problem: Implied (need more leads/clients)
- Solution: Outbound marketing (mechanism)
- Social proof: Lead Gen Jay's success + USA Today article

**Example 2 (Ghostwriting):**
"I think every executive of your caliber needs a bestseller. Would it be all right if I put together a book title and complete outline for your next bestseller?"

- Problem: Need authority/credibility (executives need books)
- Solution: Ghostwriting service
- Social proof: Implied (I can create bestsellers)
- Mechanism: Book title + outline (specific deliverable)

**The Personalized Social Proof Principle:**

Generic social proof: "We've helped 100+ companies"
→ Weak. Could be anyone.

Personalized social proof: "I'm running the outbound marketing for [competitor they know] after seeing their crazy success."
→ Strong. They know that competitor. They want that success.

**If you're emailing cold email agencies:**
- Don't mention you helped random SaaS companies
- Mention the biggest cold email agencies you've worked with

**If you're emailing lawyers:**
- Don't mention you helped accountants
- Mention the most famous lawyer you've worked with

**If you're emailing cosmetics brands:**
- Don't mention you helped car dealerships
- Mention successful cosmetics brands

**The Mechanism Requirement:**

Vague: "I'll get you 100 leads in 30 days"
→ How? That's just a claim. You're not emailing dummies.

Specific: "I'll get you 100 leads in 30 days through a 3-email cold email sequence targeting [specific ICP] using [specific personalization method]"
→ Now they understand HOW. Mechanism = credibility.

**Jay's Example:**
"Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online threats in under 3 months."

- Audit (specific action)
- Safeguard from threats (specific outcome)
- 3 months (specific timeframe)

Not: "We do IT services and can help you."

#### **TAP 3: GETTING ACTION (Call to Action)**

**The Low-Resistance CTA Philosophy:**

Your CTA should pass this test:

**"Can they read it and reply with one hand in under a minute?"**

If yes → Good CTA
If no → Too much friction

**Single-Word Reply Strategy:**

Your goal: Get them to reply with:
- "Yes"
- "Sure"
- "Send it"
- "Interested"

That's it. Don't ask them to:
- Click a link
- Book a calendar
- Fill out a form
- Think too hard

**Good CTAs:**

- "Would it be cool if I send over the strategy?"
- "Can I send you some information?"
- "Are you interested in learning more?"
- "Do you think your organization could benefit from this?"
- "Cool if I send over some info?"

**Bad CTAs:**

- "Book a time on my calendar here: [link]" → Too much friction in email 1
- "Fill out this form to get started" → Nobody does this from a cold email
- "Let me know what time works best for you" → Too open-ended, requires thinking

**The Reply = Qualification:**

When they reply "yes" or "sure," they've now:
- Raised their hand
- Self-identified as interested
- Opened a conversation
- Given you permission to send more info

NOW you can send:
- Calendar link
- Case studies
- Videos
- Detailed explanations

But not before. Email 1 is about getting that hand raised.

## II. COPYWRITING RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### A. Golden Rules (The DO's)

#### **1. Keep It Short: 6 Sentences Maximum**

Every additional sentence is another chance to:
- Confuse them
- Lose their attention
- Trigger spam filters
- Make them trash it

Count your sentences. If you're over 6, cut ruthlessly.

**Jay's Structure:**
- Sentence 1: Preview text/hook
- Sentences 2-3: Problem + Solution
- Sentence 4: Social proof
- Sentence 5: CTA
- Sentence 6: Optional PS or clarification

#### **2. 6th Grade Reading Level**

Why? Because:
- They're skimming, not reading carefully
- Complex language = effort = closed email
- Simple language = clarity = response

**Use AI to simplify:**

Prompt: "Simplify this to 6th grade reading level. I'm writing cold email copy and it needs to be conversational:"

[Your complex copy]

Claude or ChatGPT will simplify without losing meaning.

**Example:**

Complex: "Our proprietary methodology leverages advanced algorithmic personalization to optimize deliverability metrics and enhance engagement rates."

6th grade: "We use AI to personalize emails so more people reply."

#### **3. Tonality Must Match ICP Profile**

**Age + Gender + Industry + Sophistication = Tonality**

**Example: Cold Email Agency Owner**
- Age: 20-30s
- Gender: Likely male
- Location: Miami, Austin, remote
- Vibe: Casual, entrepreneurial, meme-literate

**Tonality:** Casual, maybe humorous, direct, no fluff

"Do you follow [competitor]? You remind me of them in the early days. If you already have more qualified leads than you can handle, then I'm sorry to waste your time. But if not, I'd love to show you our strategy."

**Example: Cosmetics Brand Owner**
- Age: 30-50s
- Gender: Likely female
- Industry: Fashion/beauty
- Vibe: Sophisticated, design-conscious, brand-focused

**Tonality:** More refined, delicate language, emphasize brand/prestige

"I've been following your brand's growth and I'm convinced [Company] is going to be the next [aspirational competitor]. I would love to do a feature article about you in USA Wire Magazine."

**Example: Car Dealership Owner**
- Age: 50-60s
- Gender: Likely male
- Industry: Traditional sales
- Vibe: Sales-focused, ROI-driven, no-nonsense

**Tonality:** Professional, results-focused, use sales language they understand

"I have a question about your current IT strategy. I see your company is growing quickly and I anticipate your need for IT services and cybersecurity will also grow. Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online threats in under 3 months."

#### **4. Establish Credibility with Social Proof**

**Social Proof Hierarchy (Best to Worst):**

1. **Case study from well-known competitor in their exact industry**
   - "I'm running the outbound marketing for [competitor they admire]"
   - "We recently helped [famous company in their space] achieve [specific result]"

2. **Results from similar company in their city/region**
   - "We helped [local competitor] triple their legal practice in 90 days"
   - "3 other agencies in [city] are using our system"

3. **Media coverage in publications they respect**
   - "Here's an article USA Today wrote about my methods"
   - "We were called 'the future of PR' by Forbes"

4. **Rankings, awards, certifications**
   - "#1 rated PR firm in the USA according to G2"
   - "Ranked Top 10 business podcasts in the US within 6 months"

5. **Social media authority**
   - "11K subscribers on YouTube"
   - "50K followers across social media"

6. **Generic numbers** (weakest)
   - "Helped 100+ companies"
   - "Over 10 years of experience"

#### **5. Be Specific About Problem and Solution (Mechanism Required)**

**Vague (Bad):**
- "I can help you grow"
- "We'll get you more leads"
- "Our system works really well"

**Specific (Good):**
- "I help lawyers go from 'regular lawyer' to celebrity attorney in 30 days by utilizing our key media relationships to turn you into a viral media lawyer"
- "We use a 3-email cold email sequence with AI-generated book titles targeting executives with 200+ employees"
- "Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online threats in under 3 months"

**The Mechanism Test:**

If someone asked "HOW do you do that?" and your email doesn't answer it, you're being too vague.

#### **6. Personalize the Social Proof to Their Industry**

This is subtle but powerful.

**Wrong:**
Emailing a cold email agency owner:
"We've helped Amazon, Google, and Microsoft with their outreach."

**Right:**
Emailing a cold email agency owner:
"We've worked with [specific cold email agencies they know] and helped them scale from $50K to $200K MRR."

The personalized social proof does two things:
1. Shows you understand their industry
2. Gives them a reference point they trust

### B. Critical Don'ts

#### **1. Never Overpromise**

**Instant Spam Triggers:**
- "I guarantee you'll get 100 leads in 30 days or your money back"
- "We'll 10X your revenue in 90 days"
- "You'll be a millionaire by next month"

**Why it fails:**
- Sounds like every other scam email
- Your prospect isn't stupid—they know guarantees like this are BS
- Instant spam report

**What to do instead:**

Be realistic and mechanism-focused:

"We recently helped [competitor] go from 5 qualified calls per month to 15-20 qualified calls per week using [specific mechanism]. I'd love to show you how we did it."

#### **2. Never Be Vague About What You Do or How You Do It**

**Vague (Bad):**
"We have a proprietary system that gets results."

**Specific (Good):**
"We use a 3-email cold email sequence sent from 10 domains, targeting [specific ICP] with personalized first lines generated by AI based on their LinkedIn activity."

Specificity = credibility. If you can't explain your mechanism, they assume you're hiding something (or you have no idea what you're doing).

#### **3. Never Confuse the Lead**

**The Confusion = Closed Email Principle**

If they don't immediately understand:
- What you do
- Who you help
- Why they should care

They close the email.

**Example of Confusing Copy:**

"We leverage synergistic paradigm shifts in your go-to-market infrastructure to optimize your lead generation funnel through omnichannel engagement matrices."

Translation: "We help you get more leads through cold email and LinkedIn."

**Why people write confusing copy:**
- Trying to sound smart/sophisticated
- Too close to their own offer (curse of knowledge)
- Using internal jargon customers don't understand

**The 6th grade reading level rule solves this.**

#### **4. Never Bait and Switch**

**Bait and Switch = Spam Reports**

**Example of Bait and Switch:**

Subject: "Your house is on fire"
Body: "Just kidding! But your marketing strategy might as well be on fire. Let me help you fix it."

→ Instant spam report. User feels deceived.

**Subject/Preview Text Must Relate to Body:**

Subject: "sending cold emails?"
Preview: "Not sure if you're sending these or not, [name]"
Body: "I noticed companies in [industry] are using cold email to generate leads. We specialize in this and work with [competitors]. Would it be cool if I sent over our strategy?"

→ Cohesive narrative. Subject relates to body. No deception.

#### **5. Never Use Promotional/Salesy Language**

**Promotional Language Triggers:**
- "Act now!"
- "Limited time offer"
- "Don't miss out"
- "Exclusive deal"
- "Only 3 spots left"
- "This week only"

**Why it fails:**
- Sounds like a marketing email (not an email from a friend)
- Triggers spam filters
- People are numb to urgency tactics

**What to use instead:**

Conversational, helpful language:

- "If you already have more qualified leads than you can handle, ignore me."
- "Not sure if this is relevant to you, but..."
- "I had to share this with you..."
- "Thought you might find this helpful"

#### **6. Avoid More Personalization Than Necessary**

**The Personalization Paradox:**

More personalization variables = more ways for things to go wrong.

**Common Personalization Failures:**

- Company name: "Acme Corporation LLC" → Looks like a cold email (no one writes "LLC" in conversation)
- Company name: "ACME CORP" → All caps = database export = cold email
- Location: "I saw you're in Austin, Texas" → Often wrong (HQ ≠ where person works)
- Location: "Being in [city] probably means..." → Awkward phrasing, doesn't sound natural

**What Actually Works:**

- First name: Always use, always works
- Job title: Can work if used naturally ("As a CEO, you probably...")
- Industry: Safe if from reliable data ("Companies in [industry] often struggle with...")
- Competitor mention: Powerful if accurate ("Do you follow [competitor]?")

**The Rule:**

Only use personalization if:
1. You're confident it's accurate
2. It sounds natural in conversation
3. It adds value (not just "I researched you")

---

## III. EMAIL SEQUENCE STRUCTURE

### A. Sequence Length Strategy

**Current Best Practice (2024-2025): 3 Emails Maximum**

**Why 3 emails is the sweet spot:**

1. Email 1 almost always performs best (gets most replies)
2. Each additional email increases spam risk
3. If they didn't reply to email 1-2, they're probably not interested
4. Better to reach NEW people than keep emailing the same uninterested person

**Jay's Philosophy:**

"The shorter the sequence, the more leads you can reach. If the sequence is longer, it ends up emailing less people, but more often. If the sequence is shorter, you're able to reach out to more people over a shorter period of time."

**When to Use Short Sequences (1-2 Emails):**

✅ You have a large TAM (millions of potential prospects)
✅ You have access to cheap lead data
✅ You want to maximize reach and speed
✅ You have fewer mailboxes (running lean)
✅ You want to prioritize volume over persistence

**Example Use Case:**

Selling cold email services to marketing agencies:
- TAM: 50,000+ agencies in the US
- Lead cost: $0.10-0.20 per lead
- Better to email 10,000 people once than 1,000 people 10 times

**When to Use Extended Sequences (4-7 Emails):**

✅ You have a very small TAM (hundreds, not thousands)
✅ Each lead is expensive or hard to acquire
✅ You have lots of social proof/lead magnets to share
✅ Each email provides NEW value (not just "following up")

**Requirements for Extended Sequences:**

1. **Each email must offer new value:**
   - Email 1: Initial pitch
   - Email 2: Case study
   - Email 3: Video explaining service
   - Email 4: Lead magnet/free audit
   - Email 5: Different pain point/benefit
   - Email 6: Scarcity/urgency (use carefully)

2. **Pull at different pain levers:**
   - Email 1: Money (increase revenue)
   - Email 2: Speed (get results faster)
   - Email 3: Prestige (build authority)
   - Email 4: Risk (avoid threats)

3. **Must have opt-out language:**
   - Email 3+: "If I'm barking up the wrong tree, just say 'away' and I'll remove you."
   - Don't use "unsubscribe" (spam trigger)

4. **Monitor spam rates closely:**
   - If spam goes up, kill the extended sequence immediately
   - If reply rates drop significantly after email 3, stop there

**Jay's Warning:**

"The more emails you send, the higher the likelihood that they're going to report you as spam."

### B. Email 1: The Foundation

**Email 1 Structure:**

```
[SUBJECT LINE]

[PREVIEW TEXT - First sentence, pattern interrupt or question]

[BODY - 2-3 sentences: Problem + Solution + Social Proof]

[CTA - Low resistance, single word reply]

[Optional PS - Adds personality or urgency]
```

**Email 1 Critical Restrictions:**

❌ No links (especially not your own domain)
❌ No images or videos
❌ No HTML formatting
❌ No signatures (friends don't email with signatures)
❌ No opt-out language
❌ No company logos or branding

**Why these restrictions?**

Email service providers (Gmail, Outlook) are LOOKING for cold emails to filter. They check:
- Does it have links? → Cold email
- Does it have images? → Cold email
- Does it have a signature with company info? → Cold email
- Is the domain reputation low? → Cold email

**Your Goal with Email 1:**

Get into the primary inbox. That's it. Everything else is secondary.

Once you're in the inbox, emails 2-3 have much more freedom.

**Email 1 Examples:**

**Example 1 (PR Services):**

Subject: question [firstName]

Hey [firstName],

I run the #1 rated PR firm in the USA according to G2 and have been called "the future of PR" by Forbes. I help lawyers like you go from "regular lawyer" to celebrity attorney in only 30 days by utilizing our key media relationships.

We recently helped Mike Mandell, the most followed lawyer on earth, triple his legal practice by getting coverage in Forbes and Cosmo in only 90 days.

Do you think you could benefit from this?

**Example 2 (Cold Email Services):**

Subject: [competitor name]

Do you follow [competitor]? You remind me of them in the early days.

I've been sending leads to industry leaders in [industry] for about 10 years. My model is entirely pay-per-results.

If you already have more qualified leads than you can handle, then I'm sorry to waste your time. Do you already have someone sending you leads?

**Example 3 (Ghostwriting Services):**

Subject: bestseller

Hey [firstName],

I think every executive of your caliber needs a bestseller. Would it be alright if I put together a book title and complete outline for your next bestseller?

**Notice:**
- All under 6 sentences
- Clear problem + solution
- Social proof integrated naturally
- Low-friction CTA
- No links, images, signatures

**Spacing: 2-5 Days Before Email 2**

Don't send email 2 the next day. Give them time to:
- Check their email
- Process your message
- Respond if interested

Jay recommends 2-5 days between emails.

### C. Email 2: The Bump

**Email 2 Philosophy:**

Keep it simple. This is just a gentle reminder.

**Email 2 Structure:**

```
[SAME THREAD as Email 1]

[Simple bump]
```

**Email 2 Critical Rule:**

**SAME THREAD.** Do not start a new email thread. Reply to email 1.

**Why?**

1. They can see the context (your original email is right there)
2. It's less intrusive (feels like a follow-up, not a new cold email)
3. If email 1 made it to the inbox, email 2 will too (already passed spam filters)

**Email 2 Template:**

"Just touching base here. If you had a chance to review my last email, let me know. Or can I provide some additional information?"

**Even Simpler:**

"Did you get my last email?"

**That's it.** No need to re-pitch, no need to add more info.

**Jay's Insight:**

"Did you get my last email? Almost everybody opens that."

**Why This Works:**

- It's direct
- It implies the email might have been missed (gives them an out)
- It's low-pressure
- It doesn't feel salesy

**Email 2 Example (Full):**

[Same thread as Email 1]

Hello [firstName]! Did you see my last email?

[Original service] is a [description]. We would love to have you as a client/partner/guest. Here are some details...

- [Bullet 1]
- [Bullet 2]
- [Bullet 3]

Do you have any time to discuss?

**Or Even Simpler:**

[Same thread as Email 1]

Hey [firstName], did you get my last email?

Can I provide some additional info?

### D. Email 3: The Dump

**Email 3 Philosophy:**

NOW you can dump information on them. They've seen your email twice. If they're skeptical or want more info, this is your chance.

**Email 3 Structure:**

```
[NEW thread OR same thread - test both]

[Subject line that re-engages or offers new value]

[More detailed pitch with links, case studies, videos]

[Optional: Lead magnet or free offer]

[Optional: Opt-out language]
```

**Email 3 Freedom:**

✅ CAN send links (YouTube, Calendly, Loom, Vimeo)
✅ CAN send images (if relevant to the pitch)
✅ CAN send videos
✅ CAN include case study links
✅ CAN add opt-out language (delicate phrasing)

**Why This Freedom?**

If Email 1 made it to the inbox, you've already passed the spam filters. Gmail/Outlook have determined you're legitimate. They're unlikely to suddenly flag Email 3 as spam if Email 1 was fine.

**Jay's Explanation:**

"What a lot of people don't realize about emails 2 and 3 is that you're already in the inbox. If you do email 1 correctly, you've already made it through the spam filters."

**Email 3 Subject Line Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: Case Study**
- Subject: "[Case study name] had [result]"
- Example: "Mike Mandell tripled his practice"

**Strategy 2: Lead Magnet**
- Subject: "Want a free [lead magnet] 🎁"
- Example: "Want a free book outline?"

**Strategy 3: Problem/Solution Focused**
- Subject: "Your IT infrastructure"
- Subject: "Growing pains"
- Subject: "Cybersecurity protocols for [company]"

**Email 3 Example 1 (Case Study Approach):**

Subject: [competitor] had [impressive result]

Hey [name], I had to share this with you...

[Case study narrative: We helped X achieve Y in Z timeframe using our method]

[Image or video link showing results]

Do you agree results like this would be good for [company]?

Let's schedule a quick demo! I'll show you exactly how we can help.

[Calendar link]

**Email 3 Example 2 (Lead Magnet Approach):**

Subject: Want a free [lead magnet] 🎁

Hey [name], I thought you would find this helpful for [desired result].

This is the same framework that we use with our clients to help them [offer].

[Link to lead magnet]

Once you've applied what you learn here, and if you decide you're ready for a done-for-you solution, that's where I come in.

I hope this provides you with the tools to take your [department] to the next level. If you have any questions or want to chat, I'm available at the link below.

[Calendar link]

Best,
[Signature with full details now allowed]

**Email 3 Example 3 (CEO Personal Outreach):**

Subject: Growing pains

Hello [firstName],

I'm [Your Name], CEO at [Company]. I believe you need some assistance with your [service category]. Do not wait until it's too late to bring on a professional. Every large corporation has a [service] partner.

To best explain why, here is a quick video: [YouTube link]

If your company is in need of qualified [service] professionals, then I'd love to share some suggestions for your current strategy.

[Schedule Link]

Thank you,
[Full signature]

**Opt-Out Language (Use Carefully):**

If using an extended sequence (4+ emails), add gentle opt-out language starting in Email 3:

❌ Don't say: "Click here to unsubscribe"
→ Spam trigger

✅ Do say: "If I'm barking up the wrong tree, just say 'away' and I'll remove you."

**Why This Works:**

- Doesn't use the word "unsubscribe"
- Conversational tone
- Gives them an easy out
- Respects their time

**When to Use New Thread vs. Same Thread for Email 3:**

**Same Thread (Recommended):**
- Feels like continuation of conversation
- Context is preserved
- Less likely to be missed

**New Thread:**
- Completely fresh start
- Can use new subject line to re-engage
- Good if emails 1-2 got buried

**Test both approaches.**

## IV. PERSONALIZATION STRATEGY

### A. What to Always Use: First Name

**First Name = Tried and True**

This is the ONE personalization variable that:
- Always works
- Rarely has data quality issues
- Sounds natural in any context

**How to Use:**

- "Hey [firstName],"
- "Question [firstName]?"
- "[firstName], just making sure I have the right person"

**When NOT to Use First Name:**

Pattern interrupt strategy: Introduce the name AFTER the hook instead of starting with it.

Normal: "Hey Sarah, I wanted to ask you about..."

Pattern interrupt: "I wanted to ask you about [topic], Sarah."

**Why This Works:**

Everyone is used to "Hey [Name]," - it's a cold email signal. Breaking that pattern can increase opens.

### B. What to Use Cautiously

#### **Company Name**

**The Problem with Company Name Personalization:**

Lead databases often export company names in formats that scream "cold email":

❌ "Acme Corporation LLC" → Nobody writes "LLC" in a casual email
❌ "ACME CORP" → All caps = database export
❌ "Acme Corporation, Inc." → Too formal

**When Company Name Works:**

✅ When you manually verify and clean the format
✅ When used naturally: "I saw [Company] is growing quickly"
✅ When you use the brand name, not legal entity name

**Example:**

Database: "Apple Inc."
Use in email: "Apple"

Database: "Microsoft Corporation"
Use in email: "Microsoft"

**Best Practice:**

Create a "Company Name Cleanup" variable that removes:
- LLC, Inc., Corp, Ltd.
- All caps formatting
- Punctuation issues

#### **Location/City**

**The Problem with Location Personalization:**

- Often inaccurate (HQ location ≠ where person works)
- Sounds unnatural in conversation
- Can feel creepy ("I know where you live")

**When Location DOESN'T Work:**

❌ "Hey [Name], I saw you're in Austin, Texas..."
→ Stiff, unnatural

❌ "Being in [City] probably means you face [problem]..."
→ Awkward phrasing

**When Location CAN Work:**

✅ Local social proof: "We've worked with 3 other agencies in Austin"
✅ Regional relevance: "Companies in the Southeast are facing [specific regional issue]"
✅ Competitor proximity: "I noticed you're based in [City], just like [competitor]"

**Best Practice:**

Only use location if:
1. You're confident it's accurate
2. It adds genuine value (not just "I researched you")
3. It sounds conversational

#### **Job Title**

**The Challenge with Job Title:**

- Database titles are often stale or incorrect
- Titles vary widely by company (VP at one company = Director at another)
- Can sound overly formal

**When Job Title Works:**

✅ High-level, unlikely to change: "As a CEO/Founder..."
✅ Industry-standard titles: "As a CFO, you probably..."
✅ Flattery/importance: "Every executive of your caliber should have..."

**When Job Title Fails:**

❌ "Hey [firstName], I see you're a Marketing Manager III"
→ Overly specific, sounds like database export

❌ "As someone in the [JobTitle] role, you must struggle with..."
→ Generic, could apply to anyone

**Best Practice:**

Generalize job titles into broader categories:
- VP/Director/Manager → "Marketing leader"
- CEO/Founder/President → "Executive"
- Engineer/Developer/Architect → "Technical leader"

### C. AI Personalization (Advanced)

**The AI Personalization Paradox:**

Jay's warning: **"95% of people using AI personalization are hurting their campaigns rather than helping."**

**Why AI Personalization Usually Fails:**

1. **Outputs are generic**: AI says the same vague thing about everyone
2. **Sounds AI-generated**: Prospects can tell it's not human-written
3. **Data quality issues**: AI hallucinates or makes assumptions
4. **Adds length**: Most AI personalization adds 2-3 sentences, making emails too long
5. **Doesn't add value**: "I saw you posted about X on LinkedIn" → So what?

**When AI Personalization Works:**

When it **creates something unique and valuable** for the prospect that requires them to respond.

**Jay's Success Story: Podcast Outreach**

Campaign: Getting booked on podcasts

**AI Personalization Used:**
Generated custom episode titles combining:
- Host's podcast theme
- Jay's expertise (cold email)
- Recent trends in the industry

**Example:**

Host: Marketing podcast focused on SaaS growth
AI-Generated Title: "From 0 to 100 Qualified Demos: Cold Email Strategies for SaaS Founders"

**Why This Worked:**

1. **Valuable**: Host can actually use this episode title
2. **Relevant**: Customized to their podcast and audience
3. **Shows effort**: Not generic copy-paste
4. **Curiosity driver**: "Wow, they really thought about this"

**Result:** Most successful campaign Jay has run

**How to Implement AI Personalization Correctly:**

**Step 1: Get Rich Data**

You need MORE than just:
- Name
- Company
- Email

You need:
- Industry
- Company description/SEO keywords
- Recent company news
- LinkedIn activity
- Website content
- Job description

**Step 2: Create Valuable Output**

AI should generate something they can USE, not just mention:

❌ Bad: "I saw you posted about AI on LinkedIn recently"
→ Generic, adds no value

✅ Good: "I created this book title for you: '[AI-Generated Book Title Based on Their Expertise]'"
→ Valuable, shows effort, requires response

**Step 3: Validate Every Output**

**CRITICAL**: AI hallucinates. You MUST validate outputs.

**Validation Process:**

1. Generate 10-20 sample outputs
2. Read ALL variations (not just 1-2)
3. Check for:
   - Nonsensical combinations
   - Repeated patterns (is it just mad-libbing?)
   - Offensive/inappropriate content
   - Factual errors

**Jay's Method:**

"Show me all possible variations of this email and then just copy in that full email. It understands that it's Spintax and it's going to show me all the possible variations. I can't tell you how many times people will use a lot of Spintax or use AI to generate the Spintax and one or two of the variations just don't make sense when combined with each other."

**Step 4: Use It Sparingly**

AI personalization should be a SINGLE element, not the entire email.

**Structure:**

- Subject line: Generic or pattern interrupt
- Preview text: Generic hook
- Body sentence 1: AI-personalized element
- Body sentences 2-3: Standard pitch + social proof
- CTA: Standard low-friction CTA

**AI Personalization Prompts (Jay's Examples):**

**Main Prompt Structure:**

"You are an AI tasked with writing personalized cold emails based on multiple data points provided in a CSV file. The emails should be written in simple, conversational language at a 6th-grade reading level. They should be hyper-personalized to the lead and avoid sounding like they are written by AI.

The cold email should be 4-6 sentences long, starting with a personalized question to pique curiosity and ending with a call to action to reply if they are interested. Avoid using any promotional language or words that can be considered 'spammy' such as 'money, guarantee, 100%.'

**Rules:**
- CSV output should be coded correctly so it does not have strange characters
- NEVER include an email signature or signoff
- Use as many data points as possible from the CSV
- Mention something specific about their job role
- Reference something about their company (industry trend, common pain point)
- Include a detail related to their city (but don't mention city by name directly)

**Output:**
- Results into CSV as an additional column
- Double check encoding is correct
- Double check NO placeholders remain"

**Specific Personalization Prompts:**

- "Identify a competitor in [lead's industry] located in [lead's city/state] that is of similar size to [lead's company]"
- "List a common challenge faced by companies in [lead's industry] that [lead's job title] typically deals with"
- "Describe a recent trend in [lead's city/state] relevant to companies in [lead's industry]"
- "Highlight a current market trend in [lead's industry] that could impact companies of [lead's company size]"
- "Mention a new technology being adopted in [lead's industry] that [lead's job title] might find useful"

**Advanced Application: Ghostwriting Example**

**Use Case:** Selling ghostwriting services to executives

**AI Personalization:** Generate custom book titles for each prospect

**Data Required:**
- Job title
- Company name
- Industry
- Company description/SEO keywords

**AI Prompt:**

"Based on this executive's profile:
- Name: [Name]
- Title: [Title]
- Company: [Company]
- Industry: [Industry]
- Company Description: [Description]

Generate a compelling non-fiction book title that would position them as a thought leader in their industry. The title should:
- Be 3-8 words
- Sound professional and authoritative
- Relate to their specific industry
- Follow bestseller naming conventions (e.g., 'The [Adjective] [Noun]: [Benefit]')

Output only the book title, nothing else."

**Email Using This:**

Subject: Did you write this book [firstName]?

Hey [firstName],

I created this book title for you: "[AI-Generated Title]"

What if I told you we could ghostwrite and turn this book into a bestseller in 30 days?

PS: If you hate the title, you can reply telling me how much you hate it.

**Why This Works:**

1. Valuable (they can use the title even if they don't hire you)
2. Personal (customized to them specifically)
3. Curiosity driver (they want to see what you came up with)
4. Low resistance (PS acknowledges they might not like it, but gives them a reason to reply anyway)

**The 95% Who Do It Wrong:**

What most people do:

"I saw you recently posted on LinkedIn about [generic topic]. I thought you'd be interested in [generic pitch]."

**Why this fails:**
- Adds 2 sentences of fluff
- Doesn't add value
- Everyone does this now (pattern recognition)
- Feels stalky, not helpful

### D. Personalization Best Practices Summary

**Always Use:**
- ✅ First name

**Use Cautiously (Clean the Data):**
- ⚠️ Company name (remove LLC/Inc/Corp, fix formatting)
- ⚠️ Job title (generalize to broader categories)

**Use Rarely (Only If High Value):**
- ⚠️ Location/city (social proof context only)
- ⚠️ Recent activity mentions (only if truly relevant)

**Advanced (High Risk, High Reward):**
- ⚠️ AI-generated personalized content (book titles, episode ideas, specific insights)
  - Must validate every output
  - Must add genuine value
  - Must sound human-written

**The Core Rule:**

"More is not always better. In fact, the more personalization that you use, the higher the chances that one of those things is wrong or signals that it's a cold email." - Lead Gen Jay

---

## V. DELIVERABILITY & TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### A. Spintax (Non-Negotiable)

**What is Spintax?**

Spintax (spin syntax) is a formatting technique that randomly shuffles words and phrases in every email sent.

**Example:**

```
{{Hello|Hey|Hi}} {{firstName}},

{{I wanted to|I'd like to|I hope to}} {{connect|reach out|get in touch}} with you about {{your company's|[companyName]'s}} {{growth|expansion}}.
```

**This generates variations like:**

- "Hi John, I wanted to connect with you about your company's growth."
- "Hey John, I'd like to reach out with you about Acme's expansion."
- "Hello John, I hope to get in touch with you about your company's expansion."

**Why Spintax is Mandatory:**

Email service providers (ESP) like Gmail and Outlook scan for repeat emails. If they see:
- Same subject line sent 100 times
- Same email body sent 100 times
- Same phrases appearing in multiple emails

They flag it as bulk/spam and block it.

**Jay's Position:**

"It is now mandatory. This is not optional. If you're sending cold emails, you must have Spintax. And there's really no excuse not to at this point."

**How Much Spintax?**

**Minimum:**
- Subject line variations (3+ options)
- First sentence variations (3+ options)
- CTA variations (3+ options)

**Recommended:**
- Every sentence has at least 2-3 variations
- Key phrases have 3-5 variations
- Connector words randomized (but, and, so, also, additionally)

**Spintax Format:**

```
{{option1|option2|option3}}
```

**Important:** The vertical bar `|` separates options.

**Example Cold Email with Full Spintax:**

```
Subject: {{question|quick question|question for you}} {{firstName}}

{{Hello|Hey|Hi}} {{firstName}},

{{I wanted to confirm|Just confirming|I'd like to verify}} that you are the right person to discuss {{cold email|email outreach|lead generation}} with.

{{I run|I'm the founder of|I lead}} the {{#1 rated|top-rated|highest-rated}} {{PR firm|public relations agency|media relations company}} in the USA {{according to|per|based on}} G2.

{{I help|I assist|I work with}} {{lawyers|attorneys|legal professionals}} like you {{go from|transform from|evolve from}} "regular lawyer" to {{celebrity attorney|media lawyer|authority figure}} in {{only|just}} 30 days.

{{Would you|Could you|Do you think you could}} benefit from this?

{{Let's schedule|Let me schedule|Can we schedule}} a {{quick|brief|short}} demo {{so I can|to}} provide some personalized feedback.

{{Thank you|Thanks|Best}},
[Signature]
```

**How to Generate Spintax:**

**Option 1: Instantly AI Built-in Tool**

1. Write your email copy
2. Click "AI Tools" at bottom of composer
3. Select "AI Spintax Writer"
4. Review generated variations
5. Check spam words simultaneously

**Option 2: ChatGPT/Claude**

Prompt: "Add Spintax variations to this cold email. Use the format {{option1|option2|option3}}. Provide at least 3 variations for each sentence while maintaining the core meaning. Ensure all variations sound natural and conversational."

[Paste your email]

**Option 3: Jay's Custom GPT** (mentioned in research)

Jay has built a custom GPT specifically trained on:
- His Spintax patterns
- Spam words to avoid
- Conversational language

**Critical: Preview ALL Variations**

**The Validation Problem:**

AI-generated Spintax often creates combinations that don't make sense.

**Example:**

```
{{I'd love to|I'm excited to|I'm eager to}} {{help you|assist you|support you}} {{grow|expand|scale}}
```

Most combinations work:
- "I'd love to help you grow" ✅
- "I'm excited to assist you scale" ✅

But some sound weird:
- "I'm eager to support you expand" ❌ (grammatically awkward)

**Jay's Solution:**

"Copy all of your Spintax and come into an AI platform and say, 'Show me all possible variations of this email' and then just copy in that full email. It's going to show me all the possible variations. I can't tell you how many times people will use a lot of Spintax or use AI to generate the Spintax and one or two of the variations just don't make sense when combined with each other."

**Validation Prompt:**

"Show me all possible variations of this email with Spintax. Output each unique variation on a new line:

[Your email with Spintax]"

Then manually review each variation for:
- Grammar correctness
- Natural flow
- No spam trigger words
- Maintains core message

### B. Email 1 Restrictions (Critical for Deliverability)

**Why Email 1 Has Strict Rules:**

Email 1 is your ONLY chance to get into the primary inbox. If you trigger spam filters here, your entire campaign is dead.

Gmail/Outlook/Other ESPs check Email 1 for signals that it's a cold email:
- ✅ Has links? → Probably cold email
- ✅ Has images? → Probably cold email
- ✅ Has signature? → Probably cold email
- ✅ Has company logo? → Probably cold email
- ✅ Has HTML formatting? → Probably cold email

**Email 1 Restrictions (NEVER VIOLATE):**

❌ **No Links**
- No calendar links
- No website links
- No case study links
- No social media links
- No "click here" anything

**Exception:** NO EXCEPTION. Zero links in email 1.

❌ **No Images**
- No company logos
- No headshots
- No product images
- No embedded graphics

❌ **No Videos**
- No YouTube embeds
- No Loom links
- No video thumbnails

❌ **No Signatures**
- No "Best regards, [Name]"
- No company name/title below message
- No phone numbers
- No social media icons
- No "Sent from iPhone" (disable this in settings)

**Why no signatures?**

"Friends don't email friends with signatures." - Lead Gen Jay

If you're emailing someone you know, you don't sign off with your full title, company, phone number, and social links. That's what cold emailers do.

❌ **No HTML Formatting**
- No bold text
- No italic text
- No colored text
- No fancy fonts
- No bullet points (use dashes if needed)

**Email 1 = Plain Text Only**

❌ **No Opt-Out Language**
- No "unsubscribe" links
- No "If you want to opt out..."
- No "To stop receiving emails..."

**Why?**

The word "unsubscribe" is a MASSIVE spam trigger. ESPs know that cold emails have unsubscribe links. Personal emails don't.

**Jay's CAN-SPAM Experience:**

"I've been doing this for over a decade. I've worked with all of the biggest cold email names in the business. I've built hundreds of cold email systems, a lot of which do not follow those rules and have never heard of a single violation."

Even when an attorney reported him for CAN-SPAM violations and emailed Google, Microsoft, his domain registrar, and his hosting provider... nothing happened.

**But:**

Using unsubscribe links and opt-out language DOES hurt deliverability. So while you might not get fined, your emails will go to spam.

### C. Emails 2-3 Freedoms

**Once Email 1 Gets Into the Inbox:**

You've passed the spam filters. Gmail/Outlook have determined you're legitimate. Now you have more freedom.

**Jay's Explanation:**

"What a lot of people don't realize about emails 2 and 3 is that you're already in the inbox. If you do email 1 correctly, you've already made it through the spam filters. You're already in their primary inbox. And almost every case, Google and Microsoft aren't gonna take you out of their inbox and put you in spam the third time that you send them an email."

**Email 2-3 Allowed:**

✅ **Links** (with caveats)
✅ **Images** (if relevant to pitch)
✅ **Videos** (YouTube, Loom, Vimeo)
✅ **Signatures** (full contact info now okay)
✅ **Opt-out language** (gentle phrasing)
✅ **HTML formatting** (use sparingly)

**Link Strategy for Emails 2-3:**

**Use High-Authority Domains:**

✅ Calendly.com
✅ YouTube.com
✅ Loom.com
✅ Vimeo.com
✅ LinkedIn.com

❌ Avoid your own domain links if possible

**Why?**

People trust familiar domains. They know:
- Calendly = calendar booking (not a virus)
- YouTube = video (safe to click)
- Loom = screen recording (legitimate)

But if you send them to:
- coldemailvmonsters.com/book (new domain they've never heard of)
- yourbrand.io/schedule (weird TLD, low trust)

They might not click, and it MIGHT still trigger spam filters.

**Jay's Recommendation:**

"If you're gonna use links, make sure that their links people are familiar with and willing to click on."

**Don't Hyperlink:**

Instead of:
"[Schedule a call here](calendly.com/yourname)"

Do:
"You can schedule here: calendly.com/yourname"

Raw links feel more genuine.

**Image Strategy for Emails 2-3:**

**Only Use Images If They Genuinely Help:**

Jay's example: Client selling commercial window replacement

"They identified a problem that these commercial companies are having with their existing windows, and it's really hard to explain with words, really easy to explain with a picture. So we used it in email 2, and it worked like crazy. We got a ton of replies from that."

**Rule:**

Image should be NECESSARY to communicate the value, not just decorative.

❌ Company logo → Adds nothing
❌ Headshot → Adds nothing
❌ Generic stock photo → Adds nothing

✅ Before/after comparison → Shows value
✅ Diagram explaining complex concept → Simplifies message
✅ Screenshot of results → Proof

**Video Strategy for Emails 2-3:**

**Option 1: Ask Permission in Email 1**

Subject: question [firstName]

Hey [firstName],

[Pitch]

Would it be okay if I sent you a quick video explaining how this works?

**Why This Works:**

Low-friction CTA. They just say "yes" and then you send the video in your reply.

**Option 2: Include Video in Email 3**

Once you're in the dump phase (email 3), you can include a video link directly:

"To best explain why, here is a quick video: [YouTube link]"

**Video Best Practices:**

- Keep it short (2-5 minutes max)
- Host on YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom (high-authority domains)
- Don't embed (use raw link instead)
- Explain what's in the video ("Here's a 3-minute breakdown of...")

**Opt-Out Language for Extended Sequences:**

If you're running a 4+ email sequence, add gentle opt-out language starting in email 3:

**Bad:**
❌ "Click here to unsubscribe"
❌ "If you'd like to be removed from this list..."
❌ "To opt out, reply STOP"

**Good:**
✅ "If I'm barking up the wrong tree, just say 'away' and I'll remove you."
✅ "If this isn't relevant, let me know and I'll stop emailing."
✅ "Not interested? Just reply 'not interested' and I'll remove you."

**Why This Phrasing Works:**

- Conversational (not robotic)
- Doesn't use spam trigger words ("unsubscribe")
- Respects their time
- Low friction (just reply with one word)

### D. Once They Reply: All Rules Lifted

**The Game Changes After First Reply:**

Once your prospect replies to your cold email, ESPs now see it as an ongoing conversation, not a cold email campaign.

**Now You Can:**
✅ Send unlimited links
✅ Send images
✅ Send videos
✅ Send PDFs
✅ Send calendar invites
✅ Use HTML formatting
✅ Send from a different email address
✅ Forward to your main inbox

**Jay's Important Note:**

"Once they reply, it's no longer a cold email. You now have an open dialogue with that person. The ESP sees that you can send them whatever you want. It's now an ongoing conversation."

**Instantly AI Uni-Box Strategy:**

When a prospect replies, respond from Instantly's Uni-Box (consolidated inbox), NOT by forwarding to your personal email and replying from there.

**Why?**

If you forward their reply to your main inbox (steve@company.com) and reply from there, ESPs see it as:

"First email: From sent-mailbox-1@yourdomains.com
Reply: To steve@company.com
Response: From steve@company.com"

Now it looks like steve@company.com is initiating a NEW cold email to them (no prior dialogue between these two addresses).

**Solution:**

Reply directly from the same mailbox that sent the original cold email. Instantly's Uni-Box lets you do this across all your sending domains.

## VI. OFFER POSITIONING & FRONT-END STRATEGY

### A. The Lead Magnet Approach

**Why Lead Magnets Work in Cold Email:**

Traditional cold email: "Want to book a call?"
→ High friction. They don't know you. They don't trust you.

Lead magnet cold email: "Want a free [valuable thing]?"
→ Low friction. They get value even if they don't buy.

**Jay's Philosophy:**

"A PDF or a video doesn't cut it anymore. People will need a little bit more than that."

**High-Value Lead Magnet Characteristics:**

1. **Automated** → You can't manually fulfill for thousands of prospects
2. **Valuable standalone** → They get value even if they never hire you
3. **Requires their input** → They answer questions, which qualifies them + warms them up
4. **Demonstrates your capability** → They see a preview of what you can do

**Jay's Lead Magnet Examples:**

**Example 1: USA Wire Free Article**

Offer: Free article published in USA Wire Magazine

Process:
1. Prospect replies "yes"
2. They fill out interview questions (5 minutes)
3. AI/writers create article from answers
4. Article published with their name

Value: Free PR, builds authority, low effort

**Example 2: Book Title + Outline Generator (Ghostwriting)**

Offer: Custom book title and complete outline for their next bestseller

Process:
1. Prospect replies "bestseller"
2. They answer questions about their expertise
3. AI generates book title + chapter outline
4. They receive it via email

Value: Actual book outline they can use, demonstrates writing quality

**Example 3: Free Cybersecurity Audit (IT Services)**

Offer: Free audit of their current IT infrastructure/cybersecurity

Process:
1. Prospect replies "interested"
2. They answer questions about current setup
3. Your team runs automated scan or review
4. They receive audit report with recommendations

Value: Identifies vulnerabilities for free, demonstrates expertise

**Example 4: Custom Episode Title (Podcast Outreach)**

Offer: Here's an episode idea customized for your podcast

Process:
1. AI generates episode title combining their podcast theme + your expertise
2. Include in email 1: "I created this episode idea for you: '[Title]'"
3. PS: "Even if you hate it, you can reply telling me how much you hate it"

Value: Usable content idea, shows you understand their show

**The Lead Magnet Funnel:**

Email 1 (Low Friction):
"Would it be all right if I put together a book title and complete outline for your next bestseller?"

→ Reply: "bestseller"

Email 2 (Deliver Lead Magnet):
"Awesome! Here's a link to answer 5 quick questions: [form link]

Once you submit, you'll receive your custom book title and complete outline within 24 hours."

→ They fill out form

Email 3 (Deliver + Upsell):
"Here's your book title: '[Custom Title]'

[Complete outline]

Love it? If you'd like us to ghostwrite the entire book and turn this into a bestseller in 90 days, let's chat: [calendar link]"

**Why This Works:**

1. Email 1 = Super low friction (just say "yes")
2. Form = Qualifies them (only serious people fill it out)
3. Delivery = Demonstrates value (they see your quality)
4. Upsell = Natural progression (they already have the outline, now they want it written)

**Lead Magnet Positioning in Email Sequence:**

**Option 1: Email 1 CTA**
Use the lead magnet as the primary CTA

"Cool if I send over a free [lead magnet]?"

**Option 2: Email 3 Offer**
Use lead magnet in the "dump" email

"Since you didn't respond to my last two emails, I wanted to offer something: a completely free [lead magnet]. No strings attached: [link]"

**Test both approaches.**

### B. Finding the Hook: What Makes Them Care?

**The Core Problem in Cold Email:**

You're interrupting someone's day with your offer. They don't care about YOUR offer. They care about THEIR problems.

**Jay's Strategy:**

"My goal is, one, make it interesting, find a need, a pain point that these decision makers have in their business. And then two, offer a carrot."

**Step 1: Identify THEIR Pain Point (Not Your Service)**

**Wrong Approach:**
"We offer managed IT services, cloud solutions, and cybersecurity monitoring."
→ This is what YOU do, not what THEY need.

**Right Approach:**
"Are you worried about online threats to your company data?"
→ This is THEIR pain point.

**How to Find the Pain Point:**

1. **Talk to existing customers** → What problem did you solve for them?
2. **Read industry forums/Reddit** → What do people in this industry complain about?
3. **Check competitor messaging** → What pain points are they targeting?
4. **Ask "What keeps them up at night?"** → What's the worst-case scenario they're avoiding?

**Example: IT Services Cold Email**

**Service offered:** Managed IT services, cloud migration, cybersecurity, helpdesk

**Pain points in order of urgency:**
1. Cybersecurity threats (scariest)
2. Downtime costs (costly)
3. Slow IT response times (annoying)
4. Managing IT infrastructure (time-consuming)

**Jay's Chosen Hook:**

"I have a question about your current IT provider. I see your company is growing quickly and I anticipate your need for IT services and cybersecurity will also grow. Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online threats in under 3 months."

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with scariest pain point (threats)
- Time-bound promise (3 months)
- Free value (audit)
- Doesn't lead with "managed services" (less sexy)

**Step 2: Offer a Carrot (Immediate Value)**

**The Carrot Strategy:**

Give them something valuable RIGHT NOW that they can benefit from even if they don't hire you.

**Carrot Examples:**

**IT Services:**
"I'd love to make some suggestions if you're up for it."
→ Free consultation/recommendations

**Ghostwriting:**
"Would it be all right if I put together a book title and complete outline for your next bestseller?"
→ Free book outline

**Cold Email Services:**
"I'd love to show you the strategy we used for [competitor]."
→ Free strategy walkthrough

**SEO Services:**
"I just found you on Google. It looks like you're ranked #[X] for [keyword]. Any interest in moving up that rank? I can give you some recommendations."
→ Free SEO recommendations

**The Carrot Must Be:**
1. ✅ Valuable even if they don't buy
2. ✅ Quick to deliver (not a 2-hour audit)
3. ✅ Demonstrates your expertise
4. ✅ Easy for them to say yes to

**Step 3: Don't Lead with What You WANT to Sell**

**Jay's Example: IT Services**

"I know that you're also offering managed services and other IT services outside of cybersecurity. My thought process is let's bait them with what their pain point is. And that's either IT services, so they need help managing the servers at their company, or cybersecurity safeguarding from online threats. So that's the angle that I went with here.

I don't wanna say managed services because it's not a sexy first email. They don't know who you are and they've never heard from you before. But it's definitely something that you can sell them once you get into a conversation with them.

This is figure out what their pain point is and get on a call to sell them what they actually need."

**The Trojan Horse Strategy:**

Email 1: Lead with the sexiest problem (cybersecurity)
Call: Sell the full suite (managed services, cloud, helpdesk, cybersecurity)

You're not lying. You DO offer cybersecurity. But you're using it as the hook to get the conversation started.

### C. Social Proof Hierarchy

**The Social Proof Ladder (Most Powerful to Least):**

**Tier 1: Well-Known Competitor in Their Industry**

"I'm running the outbound marketing for Lead Gen Jay after seeing their pretty crazy success. I was hoping I could do the same for you."

**Why This Works:**
- They know who Lead Gen Jay is
- They probably respect/admire that person
- They want similar results
- It's specific and verifiable

**Tier 2: Results from Similar Company in Their City/Region**

"We helped [local competitor] triple their legal practice in 90 days by getting coverage in Forbes and Cosmo."

**Why This Works:**
- Local relevance (they might even know the company)
- Similar scale (if competitor is their size, it's achievable)
- Regional credibility

**Tier 3: Media Coverage in Publications They Respect**

"Here's an article that USA Today wrote about my methods."
"We've been called 'the future of PR' by Forbes."

**Why This Works:**
- Third-party validation
- Media = authority
- Demonstrates reach

**Tier 4: Rankings, Awards, Certifications**

"I run the #1 rated PR firm in the USA according to G2."
"We were just ranked in the Top 10 for Business Podcasts in the US within 6 months."

**Why This Works:**
- Quantifiable
- Verified by third party
- Shows you're established

**Tier 5: Social Media Authority**

"I have 11K subscribers on YouTube teaching [topic]."
"50K followers across social media platforms."

**Why This Works:**
- Demonstrates expertise
- Shows you practice what you preach
- Gives them a way to verify you

**Tier 6: Generic Numbers (Weakest)**

"We've helped 100+ companies"
"Over 10 years of experience"

**Why This Is Weak:**
- Everyone says this
- Not verifiable
- Not specific
- Could be true or completely made up

**How to Find Personalized Social Proof:**

**If you have 10+ case studies:**

Create a spreadsheet:
- Client name
- Industry
- Location
- Company size
- Result achieved

Then when cold emailing:
- Lawyers → Mention lawyer client
- Agencies in Miami → Mention Miami agency
- SaaS companies → Mention SaaS client
- Companies with 50-100 employees → Mention similar-sized client

**If you DON'T have many case studies yet:**

**Option 1: Partner/Competitor Authority Borrowing**

"I partner with [well-known company] to provide [service] for their clients."

**Option 2: Media/Platform Authority**

"I write for [publication]"
"I've been featured on [podcast]"

**Option 3: Knowledge Authority**

"I've been doing [service] for [X years] and worked with everyone from [small examples] to [big examples]"

**Option 4: Do Free/Discount Work to Get Anchor Case Study**

Jay's advice: "It might be worth you doing some free services to get that anchor case study."

If you have NO case studies, offer:
- Free pilot to 1-2 dream clients in exchange for testimonial/case study
- Heavy discount to well-known company in your space
- Partnership where you do the work, they provide the brand name

## VII. TESTING & OPTIMIZATION

### A. What to A/B Test Aggressively

**Jay's Philosophy:**

"Test, test, test. This is really where you want to AB test your butt off and you should constantly be running AB tests on all of the different variations and ways to present your sequence."

**Testing Priority (Test These First):**

**1. Preview Text Variations (Highest Impact)**

The preview text (subject line + first sentence) determines if they open. Test relentlessly.

**Test Variables:**
- Subject line approaches (question vs. statement vs. curiosity)
- First sentence hooks (pattern interrupt vs. direct vs. personalization)
- Name placement (start vs. middle vs. end of sentence)

**Example Test:**

Variation A:
Subject: "question [firstName]"
Preview: "Hey [firstName], I have a question about..."

Variation B:
Subject: "sending cold emails?"
Preview: "Not sure if you're sending these or not, [firstName]..."

Variation C:
Subject: "[firstName]"
Preview: "Just making sure I have the right person..."

Run all three simultaneously, measure reply rates.

**2. Problem/Solution Framing (Second Highest Impact)**

How you articulate their problem and your solution directly affects whether they care.

**Test Variables:**
- Pain point emphasis (fear-based vs. opportunity-based)
- Specificity level (detailed mechanism vs. high-level benefit)
- Order (problem-first vs. solution-first)

**Example Test:**

Variation A (Fear-based):
"I see your company is growing quickly and I anticipate your need for IT services and cybersecurity will also grow. Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online threats in under 3 months."

Variation B (Opportunity-based):
"Growing companies like yours are using advanced IT infrastructure to scale faster. We help you build that infrastructure in under 3 months."

Variation C (Specific mechanism):
"We use a 3-phase IT audit process to identify vulnerabilities in your network, then implement fixes in under 3 months, protecting you from the top 10 cybersecurity threats facing [industry] companies."

**3. Social Proof Elements (Third Highest Impact)**

Which social proof resonates most with your ICP?

**Test Variables:**
- Type of proof (case study vs. media vs. rankings vs. social following)
- Specificity (named client vs. anonymous result)
- Placement (early in email vs. late in email)

**Example Test:**

Variation A (Named competitor):
"I'm running the outbound marketing for Lead Gen Jay after seeing their crazy success."

Variation B (Result-focused):
"We recently helped a cold email agency go from $50K to $200K MRR in 6 months."

Variation C (Media authority):
"Here's an article USA Today wrote about my methods: [context about article]."

**4. CTA Language (Fourth Highest Impact)**

The exact wording of your call to action affects conversion.

**Test Variables:**
- Question style (open-ended vs. yes/no)
- Action requested (send info vs. schedule call vs. reply if interested)
- Friction level (direct calendar link vs. "reply if interested")

**Example Test:**

Variation A:
"Would it be cool if I sent over the strategy?"

Variation B:
"Do you think your organization could benefit from this?"

Variation C:
"Interested in learning more?"

**5. Sequence Length (Strategic Level Test)**

Does a 2-email sequence outperform a 3-email sequence for your ICP?

**Test:**
- Sequence A: Email 1 + Email 2 only
- Sequence B: Email 1 + Email 2 + Email 3

Measure:
- Overall reply rate
- Opportunity rate
- Spam complaint rate

**6. Tonality (ICP-Specific Test)**

Does professional tonality outperform casual tonality for your audience?

**Test Variables:**
- Formal vs. casual language
- Humor vs. straight-forward
- Lengthy vs. super concise

**Example Test:**

Variation A (Professional):
"I wanted to reach out to discuss how we might be able to support your organization's growth initiatives through our lead generation services."

Variation B (Casual):
"Do you follow [competitor]? You remind me of them in the early days. If you already have more qualified leads than you can handle, ignore me."

**Which one wins? Depends entirely on your ICP.**

### B. How to Test Effectively

**Testing Infrastructure:**

**Use Instantly AI's Built-In A/B Testing:**

1. Create campaign
2. Add multiple email variations for Email 1
3. Instantly automatically splits traffic evenly
4. After statistical significance, declare a winner

**Sample Size Requirements:**

Minimum per variation:
- 100 sends for directional data
- 300 sends for moderate confidence
- 500+ sends for high confidence

**Statistical Significance:**

Don't call a winner after 20 sends. Wait until:
- At least 100 sends per variation
- At least 10 replies per variation (if possible)
- Clear performance gap (20%+ difference in reply rate)

**Metrics to Track:**

**Primary Metric: Reply Rate**

Reply Rate = (Total Replies / Total Delivered) * 100

Note: This includes both positive and negative replies.

**Why Reply Rate?**

Open tracking is disabled in cold email (hurts deliverability), so reply rate is your proxy for:
- Open rate (they had to open to reply)
- Engagement (they cared enough to respond)

**Secondary Metric: Opportunity Rate**

Opportunity Rate = (Positive Replies / Total Delivered) * 100

Positive reply = Interest expressed ("yes," "tell me more," "send info")

This is your TRUE success metric.

**Tertiary Metric: Spam Complaint Rate**

Spam Rate = (Spam Reports / Total Delivered) * 100

Monitor this closely. If it goes above 0.3%, kill the campaign or variation immediately.

**What to Do With Test Results:**

**Scenario 1: Clear Winner (20%+ difference)**

- Keep winner
- Kill loser
- Create new variation to test against winner

**Scenario 2: Marginal Difference (5-10% difference)**

- Keep both running (could be random variance)
- Add third variation to test
- Wait for more data

**Scenario 3: Both Performing Poorly (<1% reply rate)**

- Kill both
- Rethink your offer/ICP
- Start fresh with completely new approach

**Testing Cadence:**

- Week 1-2: Test 3-4 preview text variations
- Week 3: Keep winner, test 3-4 problem/solution variations
- Week 4: Keep winner, test 3-4 social proof variations
- Week 5: Keep winner, test 3-4 CTA variations
- Week 6+: Continuous iteration on winning formula

**Never stop testing.**

### C. When to Kill a Campaign

**Kill Signals (Act Immediately):**

**1. Spam Rate Above 0.3%**

If more than 3 in 1000 recipients mark you as spam, STOP.

Why? ESPs will blacklist your domain if spam rates stay high.

**What to do:**
- Pause campaign immediately
- Review copy for spam triggers
- Check if you're targeting the right ICP
- Warm up a new domain if necessary

**2. Reply Rate Below 1% After 500+ Sends**

If you're getting <1% reply rate with a decent sample size, something is fundamentally wrong.

**What to check:**
- ICP targeting (are you emailing the right people?)
- Offer positioning (is your offer actually valuable to them?)
- Copy clarity (are you confusing them?)

**What to do:**
- Don't just tweak subject lines
- Rethink your entire approach
- Maybe your offer isn't a fit for cold email

**3. Negative Reply Rate Above 1%**

If >1% of recipients are replying with:
- "Stop emailing me"
- "How did you get my email?"
- "This is spam"
- "Remove me"

Your copy or targeting is off.

**What to do:**
- Review copy for aggressive/salesy language
- Check ICP fit
- Add softer tonality
- Consider if this audience is right for cold outreach

**4. Extended Sequence Underperforming Shorter Sequence**

If your 5-email sequence is getting fewer opportunities than your 2-email sequence, the extra emails are hurting you.

**What to do:**
- Shorten sequence
- Remove emails that aren't adding value
- Test 2-email vs. 3-email

**5. Decreasing Reply Rates Over Time**

If week 1 got 5% replies, week 2 got 3% replies, week 3 got 1% replies... your copy is burning out.

**What to do:**
- Refresh copy entirely (not just minor tweaks)
- Change angle/approach
- Test completely new messaging
- Consider if you've saturated your market

**When NOT to Kill a Campaign:**

**Scenario 1: Low volume testing**

Don't kill after 50 sends. You need minimum 100-200 sends per variation to have meaningful data.

**Scenario 2: Industry-specific slow responses**

If you're emailing CEOs or executives, expect slower reply rates. They might take 1-2 weeks to respond.

**Scenario 3: Seasonal/timing factors**

December/holidays = lower reply rates across the board. Don't panic if Q4 is slow.

**Campaign Health Scorecard:**

✅ Healthy Campaign:
- Reply rate: 3-10%
- Opportunity rate: 1-5%
- Spam rate: <0.1%
- Negative replies: <0.5%
- Consistent performance week-over-week

⚠️ Warning Signs:
- Reply rate: 1-3%
- Opportunity rate: 0.5-1%
- Spam rate: 0.1-0.3%
- Negative replies: 0.5-1%
- Declining performance

🚨 Kill Immediately:
- Reply rate: <1%
- Opportunity rate: <0.3%
- Spam rate: >0.3%
- Negative replies: >1%
- Rapidly declining performance

## VIII. ADVANCED STRATEGIES

### A. Pattern Interrupts

**The Pattern Recognition Problem:**

Your prospects receive dozens of cold emails per day. Their brains have learned to recognize the patterns:

"Hey [Name]," → Cold email, delete
"I wanted to reach out..." → Cold email, delete
"I hope this email finds you well..." → Cold email, delete

**Pattern Interrupt Strategy:**

Break their expectations to force conscious attention.

**Pattern Interrupt Technique 1: Name Placement**

**Normal:**
"Hey Sarah, I wanted to ask you about..."

**Pattern Interrupt:**
"I wanted to ask you about your cold email strategy, Sarah."

**Why This Works:**

Everyone starts with "Hey [Name]". When you DON'T, it breaks the pattern and they have to actually read it to understand.

**Pattern Interrupt Technique 2: No Greeting**

**Normal:**
"Hi [Name], I saw your company is..."

**Pattern Interrupt:**
"Not sure if you're sending cold emails or not, [Name]"

**Why This Works:**

Jumps straight into the hook. No pleasantries. Feels more direct and personal.

**Pattern Interrupt Technique 3: Unexpected Subject Lines**

**Normal:**
"Cold email services"
"Quick question"
"Introduction"

**Pattern Interrupt:**
"Did your patient ask for RPM?"
"[competitor name]"
"sending cold emails?"

**Why These Work:**

They sound like internal emails or follow-ups to existing conversations.

**Pattern Interrupt Technique 4: Mid-Sentence Name Drop**

**Normal:**
"Hey Sarah, what do you think about this book title?"

**Pattern Interrupt:**
"What do you think about this book title I came up with for you, Sarah?"

**Why This Works:**

They read the hook FIRST, then realize it's addressed to them. Creates curiosity before the sales guard goes up.

**Testing Pattern Interrupts:**

Test pattern interrupts against standard openings. Sometimes they work brilliantly. Sometimes standard performs better.

Depends on:
- How sophisticated your ICP is
- How many cold emails they receive
- Your industry

### B. The Fluffing Strategy

**What is Fluffing?**

Complimenting their title, success, or company to make them feel important.

**Jay's Explanation:**

"I don't usually like starting with a vague congratulations, like, congrats on your success at [company name], congrats on your success as CEO. But in this case it might fluff 'em up and encourage them to write a book. It's been working for one of our other campaigns too. The fluff, the like title company in the first sentence, it makes people feel important."

**When Fluffing Works:**

✅ Emailing executives/CEOs (ego-driven)
✅ Emailing authors/speakers (want recognition)
✅ Emailing successful entrepreneurs (take pride in success)
✅ Selling authority-building services (books, PR, media)

**Fluffing Examples:**

**Example 1 (Ghostwriting):**
"Congrats on your success as CEO. I think every executive of your caliber needs a bestseller."

**Example 2 (PR Services):**
"I've been following your success and I'm convinced [Company] is going to be the next [aspirational competitor]."

**Example 3 (Content Creator):**
"Your growth in [industry] has been incredible. You deserve recognition for what you've built."

**Fluffing Structure:**

1. Specific compliment (their title, growth, success)
2. Implication that they deserve more (recognition, authority, visibility)
3. Offer to provide that thing

**When Fluffing Doesn't Work:**

❌ Emailing skeptical/cynical audiences
❌ Generic compliments ("You're doing great!" without specifics)
❌ Over-the-top flattery (comes off as fake)

**The Key:**

Make it feel GENUINE, not sycophantic.

### C. The "Reply Even If You Hate It" Technique

**The Problem:**

Sometimes prospects see your personalization (AI-generated book title, episode idea, etc.) and don't like it. So they don't reply.

You've lost the lead.

**The Solution:**

Give them permission to reply negatively.

**Example (Ghostwriting with AI Book Title):**

"I created this book title for you: '[AI-Generated Title]'

What if I told you we could ghostwrite and turn this book into a bestseller in 30 days?

**PS: If you hate the title, you can reply telling me how much you hate it.**"

**Why This Works:**

**Psychology:**

1. **Lowers barrier to reply** → They don't have to be interested to respond
2. **Permission to disagree** → Feels safer than "yes/no" pressure
3. **Humor diffuses sales tension** → Shows you're self-aware and not pushy
4. **Any reply = opened conversation** → Even negative replies let you engage

**What Happens:**

Scenario 1: They love the title → "This is great! Tell me more."
Scenario 2: They hate the title → "I don't like this title"

**Your Response to Scenario 2:**

"Ha! Fair enough. What would you change about it? I can generate a few more options if you'd like."

Now you're in a conversation. They're engaged. You have a chance to build rapport and eventually pitch your service.

**Other Applications:**

**Example 1 (Episode Title for Podcast):**
"I created this episode idea for your show: '[Title]'

PS: Even if you think it's a terrible idea, reply and tell me why. I promise not to be offended."

**Example 2 (Website Audit):**
"I noticed 3 issues with [company website] that could be hurting conversions.

PS: If you think I'm completely wrong about these, reply and tell me. I'd actually be curious to hear your perspective."

**Example 3 (Strategy Recommendation):**
"Based on [company] size and industry, I think [Strategy X] would be your best approach.

PS: If you're already doing this or think it wouldn't work for you, let me know. Always interested in edge cases."

**The Core Principle:**

Give them a reason to reply EVEN IF they're not interested.

### D. The Free First Lead Strategy

**The Offer:**

"I have a hot lead for you. Think you can handle them? I'd like to provide this first lead at no charge. Seriously..."

**Why This Works:**

**Psychology:**

1. **Reciprocity** → You give first, they feel obligated to give back
2. **Proof of value** → You're demonstrating your service works before they pay
3. **Low risk** → They have nothing to lose by saying yes
4. **Specificity** → "I have a lead" is concrete, not abstract

**When to Use This:**

✅ Lead generation services
✅ Done-for-you services where you can provide a sample
✅ Referral partnerships
✅ Service businesses where sample is low-cost to you

**Full Email Example:**

Subject: I have a hot lead for you

Hey [firstName],

I have a hot lead for ya. Think you can handle them?

I have spent the past 11 years providing ready-to-close leads for consultants just like you in [City]. [Competitor] had to tell us to slow down after booking 10-15 calls/week.

I would like to provide this first lead at no charge. Seriously...

Do you think your business can handle more clients? If so, let's chat.

[Calendar link]

**Variations:**

**Variation 1 (Free Sample):**
"Can I send you a sample of our [product]? No charge, no strings attached. Just want you to experience the quality for yourself."

**Variation 2 (Free Pilot):**
"Would you be open to a free 30-day pilot? I'd love to show you what we can do without any financial risk on your end."

**Variation 3 (Free Consultation):**
"I'd like to offer you a free [service] consultation where I'll identify 3 specific areas you can improve. No pitch, no obligation."

**The Follow-Up After They Accept:**

You deliver the free value (lead, sample, pilot, consultation) and THEN pitch your full service.

**Example Follow-Up:**

"How'd that lead work out? Were they qualified?

If you'd like us to send you 10-20 more leads like that every month, we have a few spots available. Interested in discussing?"

**Why This Works Better Than Standard Cold Email:**

Standard cold email: "Want to buy my service?"
→ Trust required BEFORE trying

Free first lead strategy: "Try it free first, then decide"
→ Trust built THROUGH trying

---

## X. FINAL PRINCIPLES & REMINDERS

### 1. Simplicity Wins

"If you confuse your prospect, you lose your prospect." - Lead Gen Jay

Every word should make the email CLEARER, not more complex.

### 2. Their Problem > Your Solution

They don't care about your fancy technology or methodology. They care about their problem being solved.

Lead with their pain, not your features.

### 3. Email to a Friend, Not a Stranger

Before you hit send, ask:

"Would I send this exact email to a friend?"

If no → Rewrite until yes.

### 4. Test Everything, Assume Nothing

What works for one ICP might bomb for another.
What works in one industry might fail in another.
What worked last month might not work today.

Test. Always.

### 5. Volume + Quality = Results

You can't send 50 emails and expect 10 meetings.

Cold email is a volume game:
- 1-3% reply rate is normal
- 0.5-1% opportunity rate is good
- Need 1000+ sends to see meaningful results

But volume with bad copy = spam complaints.
Quality copy + volume = results.

### 6. Deliverability First, Everything Else Second

The best copy in the world doesn't matter if it goes to spam.

Prioritize:
1. Getting into inbox
2. Getting opened
3. Getting replies

In that order.

### 7. Once They Reply, The Game Changes

Before reply: Following strict cold email rules
After reply: Normal business conversation

Don't be afraid to send links, images, long explanations AFTER they've engaged.

### 8. Know When to Quit

Not every business is a fit for cold email.

If after 2000+ sends with tested copy you're getting <1% reply rate, consider:
- Your offer might not be a fit for cold outreach
- Your ICP might not respond to cold email
- Your pricing might be too high/low for cold acquisition

Cold email works for many businesses, but not all.

### 9. Personalization is a Tool, Not a Goal

Don't add personalization just to add personalization.

Only personalize if it:
- Adds genuine value
- Sounds natural
- Is accurate

Otherwise, keep it generic.

### 10. The Best Cold Email Doesn't Feel Like a Cold Email

If your recipient thinks:
"Wait, do I know this person?"
"Did we meet at a conference?"
"Is this a follow-up to something?"

You've succeeded.

---

## CONCLUSION

Lead Gen Jay's cold email methodology is built on a decade of pattern recognition across hundreds of campaigns and thousands of sends. The principles are counterintuitive to traditional marketing:

- Don't sell → Just identify if problem exists
- Don't explain everything → Keep it short and simple
- Don't look like a cold email → Look like a friend reaching out
- Don't pitch → Offer a carrot

The Triple Tap framework—getting the open, getting them to read, getting action—ensures every element of your email serves a specific purpose.

But frameworks are just structure. Execution requires:

**✅ Testing relentlessly** (what works for others might not work for you)
**✅ Prioritizing deliverability** (best copy means nothing in spam)
**✅ Understanding your ICP deeply** (so you can speak their language)
**✅ Offering genuine value** (carrots, not sticks)
**✅ Being willing to fail fast** (kill what doesn't work, double down on what does)

Cold email is not easy. But when done right, it's the most scalable, predictable lead generation channel available to B2B businesses.

Use this knowledge report as your foundation. Test every principle against your specific ICP and offer. Adapt what works. Discard what doesn't.

And remember: If you confuse your prospect, you lose your prospect. Keep it simple. Keep it valuable. Keep it human.
