  - Current industry trends

**Email:**

Hey {{firstName}},

I created this episode idea for your show:

"**From 0 to 100 Qualified Demos: Cold Email Strategies for SaaS Founders in 2024**"

I think your audience of {{audience-description}} would find this incredibly valuable. I've helped companies like {{competitor-example}} go from 5 demos/month to 60+ demos/month using cold email.

Interested in recording this episode?

PS: Even if you think it's a terrible idea, reply and tell me why. I promise not to be offended.

---

### AI Personalization Prompt (Main Template)

**From Jay's documentation:**

You are an AI, tasked with writing personalized cold emails based on multiple data points provided in a CSV file. The emails should be written in simple, conversational language at a 6th-grade reading level. They should be hyper-personalized to the lead and avoid sounding like they are written by AI.

The cold email should be 4-6 sentences long, starting with a personalized question to pique curiosity and ending with a call to action to reply if they are interested. Avoid using any promotional language or words that can be considered "spammy" such as "money, guarantee, 100%." The emails should not contain a signature. Every email should have a different introduction. Ensure proper encoding for a CSV file.

**Rules:**

* CSV output should be coded correctly so it does not have strange characters. Double check output.
* NEVER include an email signature or signoff.

**Steps:**

**Step 1: Understanding the Offer:**
Before generating emails, ensure you have a clear understanding of the offer being sold to the leads. If any details about the offer are unclear, ask relevant questions to clarify.

**Step 2: Incorporate Data Points:**
Use the provided data points in the CSV file, which include the person's job role, gender, location, SEO keywords, industry, and more. Use as many data points as you can.

* Mention something specific about the person based on their job role
* Reference something about their company, such as an industry trend, or a common pain point in their industry. Use the keywords or SEO description if available.
* Include a detail related to the city they are based in to show personalized research. Do not mention the city by name, say something about the city.

**Email Structure:**
First Sentence: Start with a personalized question that piques curiosity.

Body: Keep the language simple and conversational, incorporating personalized elements based on the data points.

Call to Action: Conclude with a call to action asking them to reply if they are interested.

## BEFORE & AFTER COPY REVIEWS

### Example 1: Remote Patient Monitoring (Medical Tech)

**BEFORE (Student's Version):**

**Subject**: What if I could get paid

Hey {{firstName}}, does this sound familiar?

What if I could get paid more for taking better care of your patients without adding extra work for your team?

MediSync AI makes it easy. Collect more money, get paid for taking better care of your patients. Free to test with no upfront fees.

Would you like to see if {{company name}} qualifies?

**JAY'S FEEDBACK:**

"What if I could get paid more for taking better care of your patients? What if you get paid more? Already kind of sounds like you're about to be sold to... It's just, it's going to go right to my spam folder.

...MediSync AI makes it easy. This sounds like an ad. So, we really want to try and be conversational here.

...Collect more money is definitely going to flag spam. Free is definitely going to flag spam.

...Many clinics lose money every month. Can't say lose, you can't say money in a cold email. And this is a dead-giveaway that they're about to be sold to."

---

**AFTER (Jay's Version):**

**Subject**: Did your patient ask for RPM?

Does this sound familiar?

Not sure if you are currently offering remote patient monitoring in your practice. Are you?

If you have patients with hypertension, we have an AI powered, zero upfront cost or setup time system that I think you could benefit from.

We are looking for clinics like yours to participate in our beta. No costs, only upside. It works in the background using AI to improve patient outcomes and increase your bottom line on full autopilot.

Would it be okay if I sent over some additional info?

**KEY CHANGES:**
- Subject line sounds internal ("Did your patient ask for RPM?")
- Opens with questions (not salesy statement)
- Removed "money," "free," "collect" (spam triggers)
- More conversational tone (not ad-like)
- Specific mechanism mentioned (AI powered, beta program)
- Low-friction CTA

---

### Example 2: Ghostwriting Services (Copy Development)

**DRAFT VERSIONS Jay tested:**

**Version 1 (Generic):**

**Subject**: Ghost Writer intro

Hey {{firstName}},

I heard you were thinking about writing a book. We can ghost write a bestselling book in less than 30 days.

Reply and I'll send over some info.

**Jay's Notes:** "This one's a little salesy for me. It's going straight into a pitch."

---

**Version 2 (AI Title):**

**Subject**: Did you write this book {{firstName}}?

I created this book title for you: "{{AI-GENERATED-TITLE}}"

What if I told you we could ghost write and turn this book into a bestseller in 30 days?

PS: If you hate the title, you can reply telling me how much you hate it.

**Jay's Notes:** "This will prompt a reply from people even if they do not like the AI generated title."

---

**Version 3 (Lead Magnet):**

**Subject**: bestseller

Hey {{firstName}},

Do you feel like you should publish a book?

I think every executive of your caliber absolutely should.

Would it be all right if I put together a book title and complete outline for your next bestseller?

**Jay's Notes:** "This is good for email one if we are doing the high value lead magnet."

---

**FINAL VERSION for Email 1:**

**Subject**: bestseller

{{Hey|Hi|Hello}} {{firstName}},

{{I think every|Every|I believe every}} executive of your caliber {{needs|should have|absolutely should have}} a bestseller.

{{Would it be all right|Would it be okay|Is it okay}} if I {{put together|created|generated}} a book title and complete outline for your {{next|upcoming}} bestseller?

**Jay's reasoning:**
- Fluffs them up ("executive of your caliber")
- Low-friction CTA (just say "yes")
- Lead magnet creates value
- Sets up follow-up funnel (outline → full ghostwriting service)

---

### Example 3: IT Services (Copy Refinement)

**CORE COPY Jay developed:**

**Email 1:**

**Subject**: question for {{firstName}}

Hey {{firstName}}, I have a question about your current IT provider.

I see your company is growing quickly and I anticipate your need for IT services and cybersecurity will also grow.

Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online threats in under 3 months.

I'd love to make some suggestions if you're up for it.

Do you already have an IT provider?

**JAY'S STRATEGIC REASONING (from transcript):**

"So my goal here, especially when we're talking about like IT services, not all of it is interesting enough to get clicked on, get responded to, book a meeting. So my goal is, one, make it interesting, find a need, a pain point...

Now, one of the risks with reaching out to companies with 200 plus employees is that they already have IT and cybersecurity services. So if they do, don't worry. They'll probably say we're covered or they just won't answer. But this is for companies that are growing and they don't have IT and cybersecurity in place...

I know that you're also offering managed services and other IT services outside of cybersecurity. My thought process is let's bait them with what their pain point is. And that's either IT services, so they need help managing the servers at their company, or cybersecurity safeguarding from online threats. So that's the angle that I went with here.

I don't wanna say managed services 'cause it's not a sexy first email. They don't know who you are and they've never heard from you before. But it's definitely something that you can sell them once you get into a conversation with them.

This is figure out what their pain point is and get on a call to sell them what they actually need."

---

**Email 3:**

**Subject**: Growing pains

Hello {{firstName}},

I'm Thomas Dodds, CEO at slashBlue. I believe you need some assistance with your IT management. Do not wait until it's too late to bring on a professional. Every large corporation has an IT partner.

To best explain why, here is a quick video: [YouTube link]

If your company is in need of qualified IT professionals and cybersecurity, then I'd love to share some suggestions for your current strategy.

[Schedule IT Discovery]

Thank you,

**JAY'S STRATEGIC REASONING:**

"This is where I went the more personal angle. I'm Thomas Dodds, CEO at slash blue. I love how the spelling too should raise some questions like, ooh, is that how they spell it? It's interesting. I don't usually see that. Kinda like the iPhone.

...I did some research into your company and I believe that I can add 5% in net margin through our IT strategy. This is something that I took directly from one of your comments, so I hope that we can use this and I hope that you can show them that in this video and in a call.

One thing that I really want to urge you to do, if possible, is to offer a free cybersecurity or IT audit with an offer like this. That's, you know, do you want IT services? Do you need cybersecurity services? It can be really beneficial to offer something that they want or are curious about for free.

A PDF or a video doesn't cut it anymore. People will need a little bit more than that."

## TONALITY EXAMPLES BY ICP

### Cold Email Agency Owner (20s-30s, Male, Miami/Remote)

**Tonality**: Casual, direct, no fluff, maybe humor

**Example:**

Do you follow [competitor]? You remind me of them in the early days.

I've been sending leads to industry leaders in [industry] for about 10 years. My model is entirely pay-per-results.

If you already have more qualified leads than you can handle, then I am sorry to waste your time.

Do you already have someone sending you leads?

### Cosmetics Brand Owner (30s-50s, Female, Fashion-Conscious)

**Tonality**: Refined, delicate, emphasizes brand/prestige

**Example:**

I've been following [Brand]'s growth and I'm convinced you're going to be the next [aspirational competitor].

I would love to do a feature article about you in USA Wire Magazine. You deserve it!

There is no charge for this at all. But if you feel like saying "Thanks Otter PR" when you share your success, that would be appreciated.

### Car Dealership Owner (50s-60s, Male, Traditional Sales)
