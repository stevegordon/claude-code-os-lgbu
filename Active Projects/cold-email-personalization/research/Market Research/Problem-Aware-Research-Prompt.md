# **Role & Goal**

Act as an expert level market researcher and prospect sleuth. I want you to research my target market and return a deep research report that will guide our advertising and messaging.

# **Target Market**

The target audience is 40- to 60-year-old men and women in the United States who are experienced business owners at a mid-to-late career stage. They own a small (2-25 person) professional service firm. They are in the following industries:

* B2B consultant
* Financial advisor/wealth manager
* Law
* Accounting
* Marketing/Advertising Agency
* Architecture
* And other professions where they sell their expertise as a high-ticket service

They are growth-minded, action-oriented, and ambitious, valuing credibility, influence, and financial freedom.

We are looking for information on **"Problem Aware"** prospects (Stage 2 of Eugene Schwartz's 5-Levels of Buyer Awareness). These prospects are acutely aware they have business growth problems—specifically around lead generation, client acquisition, differentiation, and scaling—but they have **not yet identified or considered book authorship as a potential solution**. They may be exploring various marketing tactics (digital ads, SEO, networking, content marketing, speaking engagements) but are unaware that writing a book could position them as the obvious authority in their space.

# **Research Task**

I want you to research this market, putting particular emphasis on direct quotes from members of the market that can be found in forums, Reddit, X (Twitter), LinkedIn discussions, Facebook groups, Quora, and other places where you can find real-person comments expressing their struggles, rather than articles and blog posts that summarize the market.

**Focus your research on uncovering their experiences with:**

* **Lead generation challenges** (inconsistent pipeline, low-quality leads, difficulty standing out)
* **Client acquisition struggles** (long sales cycles, price resistance, competition from cheaper alternatives)
* **Differentiation and positioning problems** (being seen as a commodity, struggling to articulate unique value)
* **Scaling and growth frustrations** (hit revenue plateaus, can't break into larger deals, lack of brand recognition)
* **Marketing fatigue and skepticism** (tried SEO, ads, social media with poor ROI; overwhelmed by "guru" advice)
* **Authority and credibility gaps** (not seen as the go-to expert, losing deals to more established competitors)
* **Time and resource constraints** (wearing too many hats, can't afford big marketing budgets or agencies)

**Do NOT focus on book-related discussions.** Instead, look for comments about general business growth pain points, marketing challenges, and authority-building struggles where book authorship is conspicuously absent from their consideration set.

In particular, I want you to return the following **related to their business growth and marketing challenges (NOT books)**:

* **Fears** – What keeps them up at night about growing their firm? (e.g., "What if I can't generate enough leads to sustain the business?" "What if a recession kills my pipeline?")
* **Frustrations** – What marketing/sales/growth tactics have they tried that failed or underwhelmed? (e.g., "I spent $10K on Google Ads and got zero quality leads")
* **Suspicions** – What do they distrust about marketing advice, agencies, or growth tactics? (e.g., "Every marketing 'expert' promises results but delivers nothing")
* **Desires** – What do they want their business to look like? (e.g., "I want clients coming to me instead of cold outreach")
* **Dreams** – What's their ideal business scenario? (e.g., "I want to be the first name people think of in my industry")
* **Aspirations** – What status or recognition do they seek? (e.g., "I want to speak at industry conferences" or "I want to charge 3x what my competitors charge")
* **Expressed motivations** – Why do they want to grow? What's driving their ambition? (e.g., "I want financial security for my family" or "I want my expertise to outlive me")

# **Return Format**

Return a deep research report structured as follows:

1. **Executive Summary** – A 2-3 paragraph overview of the dominant pain points, recurring themes, and emotional undercurrents in this problem-aware segment.

2. **Direct Quote Library** – Organize verbatim quotes (with source context: platform, date, thread title if available) into the 7 categories:
   * Fears
   * Frustrations
   * Suspicions
   * Desires
   * Dreams
   * Aspirations
   * Expressed Motivations

3. **Summary Table** – A concise table distilling the top 3-5 insights per category, with representative quotes.

4. **Implications for Messaging** – A brief section suggesting how to speak to these problem-aware prospects without prematurely introducing the "book solution" (focus on pain amplification and authority positioning).
