# Knowledge Report: Sam McKenna's "Show Me You Know Me" Email Copywriting Strategy

## I. Introduction and Core Philosophy

### A. Defining "Show Me You Know Me" (SMYKM)

The "Show Me You Know Me" (SMYKM) strategy is a **trademarked methodology** used for sales outreach. It is the fundamental concept of **doing research in advance** to cut through the noise and demonstrate effort to the buyer.

The core philosophy of SMYKM is the art of understanding your buyers by examining **three distinct layers** of information:

1. **The Human:** Who the buyer is as a person.  
2. **The Company:** What is happening within their organization.  
3. **The Space/Vertical:** The industry, vernacular (specific language), or relevant context tied to their business.

This technique applies across the entire sales lifecycle, extending beyond the first cold email to every subsequent touch point. Its aim is to infuse **humanity and authenticity** into the sales process.

### B. Goals of the Strategy (Standing out, building authentic connections, earning time)

The primary goal of SMYKM is to **stand out** immediately, as the bar for what buyers expect from sales communication is generally very low. Specific goals include:

* **Capturing Attention:** Making a positive and differentiating impression with the very first outreach.  
* **Earning Time:** Convincing the high-value prospect that time spent reading the email and meeting with the sender will be worthwhile.  
* **Building Relationships:** Forming more **authentic and human connections** with prospects by focusing on who they are as people, not just as "pocketbooks" or "wallet share".  
* **Driving Results:** The strategy is designed to help sellers **hit their quota** and take control of their financial and sales destiny by significantly boosting engagement.

### C. Target Audience Focus (High-value prospects, senior executives)

SMYKM is particularly effective when targeting **high-value prospects** and senior executives, as these individuals face the highest volume of generic outreach.

* **Go Higher:** Sellers are encouraged to "go high," reaching out to meaningful and sometimes **scariest titles** like **Senior Directors, VPs, EVPs, or SVPs**.  
* **Competitive Advantage:** Targeting the highest titles (CEO, VP, C-Suite) ensures that the personalized email stands out because these executives may receive 20, 30, or even 50 sales emails every single day. The effort demonstrated through SMYKM shows the seller is a **different caliber of rep**.

### D. The Competitive Landscape (Industry average vs. SMYKM results)

The industry average performance for cold emails is notoriously low, meaning the **competition is low** for those willing to personalize.

| Metric | Industry Average | SMYKM Average |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Open Rate** | Alarmingly low, around **6%** | **43%** |
| **Reply Rate** | **0.9%** (not even a full percentage point) | **20%** |

## II. Research Methodology and Prospecting

### A. The Three Layers of Buyer Understanding

SMYKM requires sellers to investigate prospects across three distinct layers: **The Human, The Company, and The Space/Vertical**.

### B. Leveraging Primary Research Sources

Research should be professional and public-facing to avoid coming across as inauthentic.

#### 1\. LinkedIn Profiles and Personal Connections

LinkedIn is the first recommended place to start research.

* **The Human Element:** Look at the prospect’s headline, the "About" section, their posts, accolades, personal goals (like traveling to every country), reading habits, or family/pets.  
* **Professional Context:** Review tenure, promotions, previous roles, and past career paths to identify authentic ties.  
* **Creepy vs. Authentic:** Anything on a professional LinkedIn profile is considered **fair game**. Avoid information from private social media, Pinterest boards, old Yelp reviews (e.g., from 2009), or anything that appears to require excessive digging.

#### 2\. Company Information and External Sources

Investigate beyond basic facts.

* **Company Resources:** Review press releases, mission statements, values, and charity initiatives.  
* **Executive Visibility:** Search for instances where the executive has been public-facing, such as speaking at conferences, writing articles, participating in webinars, or appearing on podcasts. Pulling a quote from a podcast or article can be extremely effective.  
* **CRM Data:** Check the CRM to see if the prospect has interacted with the company previously (e.g., they were a churned client, or a previous sales opportunity never closed).

#### 3\. Avoiding Generic "Compelling Events"

Do not rely on **generic compelling events** (like recent funding or a promotion).

* **Go Deeper:** If a compelling event (e.g., recent funding) is used, the seller must go **one layer down** to find specific context, like a quote from the CEO about how they plan to spend the money to achieve a public goal.

### C. Strategy for "Tumbleweed" Profiles

If a prospect's LinkedIn profile is non-existent, described as having "**effectively a tumble weed** going across it", research must shift entirely to the **Company** and **Space/Vertical** layers.

* **Leverage Company Goals:** Look for press releases that outline significant organizational objectives (e.g., doubling revenue within a few years). Then, **authentically tie the solution** to helping the company achieve that specific goal.  
* **Use Vernacular:** Focus on industry-specific language (vernacular) to demonstrate expertise in their space (e.g., using "clients" instead of "leads" in the legal sector).

### D. Quality vs. Quantity: Making the Effort

A foundational principle of SMYKM is that **quality always trumps quantity**.

* **Time Investment:** The first SMYKM email might take 30 minutes to research, but this time investment speeds up to around **5 to 7 minutes per email** as proficiency increases.  
* **Scaling Quality (When Necessary):** To efficiently scale research for similar prospects:  
  1. Target the company’s **lowest hanging fruit** or most successful vertical first.  
  2. Use a strong quote or talking point from a **C-Suite executive** (found on an external source like a podcast) and apply that insight to multiple individuals who report to that executive. By changing the vernacular, the email appears custom-written while leveraging the same high-quality research insight.

## III. The Perfect First Email Framework

### A. Subject Line: The Most Important Element

The **subject line is the most important part** of the email, amplified when paired with the first sentence.

* **Goal: Stand Out:** The subject line must be "super funky". It should be something that makes **"absolutely no sense"** except to the person reading it.  
* **Content Strategy:** Subject lines should leverage specific personal interests, goals, or unique company contexts.  
  * *Example:* "**Running podcast plus Chicago Pizza**" is highly specific.  
  * *Example:* "**Switzerland plus liip cheeseburger plus your company name**" makes sense only to the recipient.  
* **Format Recommendations:** Subject lines can be broken up using **plus signs (+)**. Shorter is not necessarily better; focus on specificity.

### B. The First Sentence / Preview Text

The subject line and the first sentence together form the **preview text**, which determines if the email is opened.

* **Avoid Generic Openers:** Strictly avoid phrases like "**Hope this finds you well**," "**Happy Monday**," or "**Just following up for my voicemail**". These signal a generic sales pitch.  
* **Approach 1: The Authentic Introduction:** Use the sentence: "**We've yet to be properly introduced, but I'm \[Your Name\], CEO of \[Your Company\]**". This signals that the seller did their homework and perhaps an introduction was warranted.  
* **Approach 2: Dive Right In:** Immediately reference the personalized content cited in the subject line (e.g., "I came across your article," "I love what you had to say about this").

### C. Transitioning to Value

A **transition** is critical to connect the personalized opening to the business value proposition.

* **Requirement for Flow:** The transition must be seamless to avoid awkward pivots.  
* **The "Read Out Loud" Test:** Sellers should **read the email out loud** to ensure it sounds natural and professional, as if the conversation were happening at a conference.  
* *Example transition phrases:* "The reason for my Outreach" or "The real reason I wanted to connect is...".

### D. Value Proposition and Challenge Storytelling

The body must immediately pivot to demonstrating tangible value.

* **Focus on the Challenge Solved:** The proposition must focus on the **challenge the buyer is facing**, *not* describing what the seller’s company does. It should be easy for the buyer to dismiss an email that only states what the seller does.  
* **Buyer Persona Specificity:** Tailor the message to the recipient's role (e.g., a message to a CRO is "very Broad and revenue focused," while a senior manager needs "in the weeds" priorities).  
* **The "So What" and Loss Aversion:** Clearly articulate the **tangible outcome**—the "so what"—of engaging. Frame the value around **loss aversion**, as buyers are more motivated to prevent a loss than achieve a potential gain.  
* **Teach and Educate:** Use the email to **teach the buyer** something they are missing or something their peers are doing, thereby creating Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD).

### E. Addressing the Hidden or Forthcoming Objection

Anticipating and countering the buyer's most common rebuttal prevents instant deletion.

* **Anticipation is Key:** Anticipate the common objection that executives think of when hearing the value proposition.  
* **Preventing Deletion:** If this objection is not addressed in the first email, the buyer will typically delete it instead of replying to argue, forcing a long sequence.  
* **Demonstrate the Differentiator:** Counter the objection and explain how the seller's offering is different or superior.  
  * *Example:* If the objection is "We have a CSM at LinkedIn," counter with how your team teaches selling, not just button pushing.

### F. The Close and Call to Action (CTA)

The close must solicit general interest while maintaining control over scheduling.

* **Solicit Interest:** Ask for **interest** (e.g., "interested in learning more") rather than pitching a specific meeting time or duration.  
* **Avoiding Calendar Links:** **Never send a calendar link** in outbound communications, and generally avoid them even in inbound/referral responses.  
  * Using a calendar link is deemed **presumptuous, rude**, and puts the **onus on the buyer**. The buyer is forced to schedule around the seller's internal meetings.  
  * The seller should prioritize the buyer’s timing to speed up the experience ("speed to lead urgency here really matters").  
* **Recommended CTA Format:** "**Do you have time over the next week or two to learn more? Let me know what works for you and I'll send a calendar invite along accordingly**".

### G. Niceties and Sign-offs (Placement and Authenticity)

* **Niceties Placement:** Niceties (like wishing someone a good weekend) should be **flipped** and placed at the **bottom of the email**. Leading with small talk (e.g., "Hope you had a really great week") sets an expectation for small talk.  
* **Sign-offs:** Choose authentic sign-offs like **"Thanks," "Cheers,"** or **"Take care"**. The sign-off "**Best**" is often perceived as passive-aggressive and should be avoided. The term "**synergies**" should be eliminated entirely.

## IV. Email Length and Format

### A. The Argument for Longer Emails (Earning the buyer's time)

The common sales advice to write extremely short emails (e.g., less than 50 words) is generally discouraged.

* **Proving Value:** A very short email is incapable of proving value or demonstrating the effort required to earn a meeting. The seller must convince the buyer that the meeting is worthwhile.  
* **Time Investment:** The buyer is more likely to invest **16 seconds** to read a thoroughly composed email that includes the value proposition and objection handling than to respond "sure" and commit 30 minutes to a meeting.  
* **Data Support:** Data from sources like Gong suggests that **longer emails work better** if they are personalized.

### B. Exceptions and Considerations (Mobile-friendliness)

Formatting must accommodate the executive's busy schedule, often read on mobile devices.

* **Clarity over Block Text:** While some prefer short emails in block text to resemble a text message, a lengthy SMYKM email must be broken up into clear sections (SMYKM hook, value proposition, CTA) to prevent the buyer's "eyes from crossing".  
* **Mobile-Friendliness:** For emails read on mobile, the text should be succinct, striving for a length that requires about **two thumb swipes**.  
* **Prioritizing the Essentials:** Do not sacrifice crucial elements—the value proposition and the hidden objection—for the sake of being short.

## V. Sequencing and Nurture Strategy

### A. Timing the Initial Email

* **Optimal Send Days:** Send the SMYKM emails on **Thursday or Friday**.  
* **Rationale:** Executives' calendars and inboxes are typically less noisy on Thursday and Friday.

### B. The Second Email Touch

The second email touch is essential for recapturing the attention of a distracted buyer.

* **Timing:** The second email must be sent **less than 48 hours** but **more than 24 hours** after the first (e.g., around 38 to 42 hours later).  
* **Weekend Strategy:** This timing often places the second touch on a **Saturday morning or Sunday evening**, which are considered great times to send, as executives often work almost 7 hours every weekend.  
* **Content and Subject Line Consistency:** The second email should **not introduce any new information**.  
  * The **subject line must not be changed** and should retain the subject line from the first SMYKM email.  
  * The content should be brief and sent as a reply-all so the original email is referenced below: "**Wanted to quickly pop in and see if you’d had a chance to read my below email. I’d still be grateful for the chance to chat with you about how \[Seller’s Company\] can support \[Recipient’s Company\].**".

### C. Utilizing LinkedIn for Follow-Up

The LinkedIn touch usually occurs around the **fourth or fifth touch** in the sequence.

* **Connection Requests with Context:** Sellers should use the connection request feature and **always include context** (a personalized message).  
  * The message should reference the emails sent to bridge the channels.  
  * *Recommended script:* "**My name might look familiar as I've sent you a few emails. I would still be grateful or appreciative of the chance to chat with you about how \[Seller’s Company\] can support \[Organization Name\]. If you're up for a chat, please let me know.**".  
* **Avoiding Pitfalls:**  
  * **Do not use InMails**, as they have become "spammy and really salesy".  
  * **Do not use the Profile View** as a touch point, as it does not impact open or reply rates.  
  * Avoid the "pitch slap"—sending a blank connection request and immediately pitching the person in the direct messages upon acceptance.

### D. Strategies for Ghosted/Lost Opportunities

* **Reviving Old Opportunities:** An easy prospecting strategy is to look at **closed-lost or canceled opportunities** in the CRM to reignite the conversation.  
* **The Breakup Email (Post-Engagement):** A breakup email should **only be sent after there has been some back and forth** (e.g., the buyer showed enthusiasm or set next steps).  
  * The email should be honest, non-defensive, and ask if something has changed (priorities, budgets, etc.) or if the seller missed the mark.  
  * The goal is to get to a **"no" faster** because "maybes are the kiss of death".

## VI. Critical Mistakes and Elements to Avoid

### A. Personalization Pitfalls

Personalization done poorly can do more harm than good.

* **Generic Compelling Events:** Avoid relying on basic facts like "Congrats on your funding" or "Congrats on your promotion," as these are easily scaled and dilute the message.  
* **Inauthentic or Creepy Research:** Do not reference content from private social media, old Yelp reviews (e.g., from 2009), or anything not publicly shared on professional sites. Avoid leading with overly personal details like "love your family beach pictures".  
* **Personalization at Scale:** Avoid subject lines and language that could be written for the recipient and "500 of their closest friends" (e.g., "Quick question," "Meeting on Tuesday," or bracketed company names).

### B. Language to Eliminate

Certain phrases immediately signal a generic sales email and should be avoided.

* **Generic Openers:** "**Hope this finds you well**," "**Happy Monday**," "**Just following up for my voicemail**".  
* **Passive/Uncertain Language:** Strictly eliminate "**Are you open to**" or awkward closes like "**Would it be the worst idea for us to meet**".  
* **Jargon:** The term "**synergies**" should be eliminated entirely from emails.  
* **Sign-offs:** Avoid the sign-off "**Best**," as it is often perceived as passive-aggressive.

### C. The Negative Impact of Calendar Links in Outbound

Calendar links should **never** be used in outbound emails.

1. **Presumption and Onus:** It is **presumptuous, rude**, and puts the **onus** on the buyer to coordinate the scheduling.  
2. **Buyer Experience:** The buyer is forced to schedule around the seller's internal calendar blockages (one-on-ones, administrative time).  
3. **Speed-to-Deal:** The seller should accommodate the buyer's timing to speed up the deal process (urgency matters). The recommended closing instead asks the buyer to suggest times.
