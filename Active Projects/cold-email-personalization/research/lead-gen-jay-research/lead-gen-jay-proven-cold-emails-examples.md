## E-COMMERCE / PHYSICAL PRODUCTS

**SUBJECT: Bad hotel coffee**

Hey {{firstName}},

Have you ever tried full-immersion brewed coffee? (Basically, premium coffee in tea bags)

Guests at the Hilton and Waldorf Astoria say that it tastes equal to or better than expensive brewed coffee, but they can make this coffee in the comfort of their room without a fancy brewing machine.

I would love to send you a sample of our ultra-premium coffee bags so you can experience it for yourself.

What is a good address to send it to?

**EMAIL 3: The top hotels are switching to this coffee.**

Hey {{firstName}},

Do you still have those tired single-serve machines in your hotel rooms?

I’d like to share an innovative idea with you. We have been able to create an ultra-premium coffee experience that tastes better than brewed coffee and actually gets used by your guests.

Our coffee comes in teabags, and we can personalize them for your unique hotel experience.

Hotels like Hilton and Waldorf Astoria have replaced traditionally brewed coffee with our bags resulting in an increase in overall guest experience. Guests also love the convenience that our coffee adds to the comfort of their hotel rooms.

Can I send over some samples for you to try? If so, just reply with a good address you'd like them sent to\!
