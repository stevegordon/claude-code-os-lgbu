1
00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:02.845
Okay, what you send is the most important factor

2
00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:05.525
for delivering a cold email as I showed you earlier

3
00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.685
and demonstrated the fastest way to go to spam is

4
00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:10.445
to say words that trigger a spam trap.

5
00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:12.045
So how do you know which words to avoid?

6
00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:13.725
Well, there's tools that you can use

7
00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:15.645
and you start to learn these intuitively over time.

8
00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:17.845
But if you are interested, there's a full list

9
00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:20.845
of spam trap words and phrases that you can avoid.

10
00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.365
It's gonna be available to you in

11
00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:23.845
that giant resources document.

12
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.045
And there's some additional tools that you can use

13
00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:28.525
that I typically reach for when I'm checking

14
00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:29.885
for these spam trap words.

15
00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:31.685
Now I just use my AI models

16
00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:34.605
that you're also gonna have access to into the resources.

17
00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:38.405
But some free things that you can use are the instantly ai.

18
00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:40.245
So you can write your copy in here

19
00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:41.965
and then have instantly check it

20
00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:43.405
for you using their AI tools

21
00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:44.885
that didn't use to work really well.

22
00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:47.525
Now it tends to be okay, the tool that I used to recommend

23
00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:49.725
and it's free and it still works really well,

24
00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:51.725
is Mail Media's Spam Checker.

25
00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.165
What is better is email guards spam checker.

26
00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:56.405
You'll need an email guard account

27
00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:58.805
and you can kind of come into Content spam checker.

28
00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.445
It'll actually give you scores

29
00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.165
and it's got a more extensive list of words

30
00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:04.565
to avoid honestly.

31
00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.565
Now that instantly has got theirs built right in,

32
00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:08.285
I don't think you'll need to use anything else.

33
00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:10.845
And they also help you replacing those spam words.

34
00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:13.165
So it doesn't get much easier than that at at this point,

35
00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:14.485
I would say let's just use instantly.

36
00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.965
Alright, this is a sensitive topic using unsubscribe links

37
00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.005
and opt out triggers.

38
00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:22.325
So 2024, the advice was you need to use them

39
00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:25.765
because it's the law and it increases deliverability.

40
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.685
We quickly learned that that is not true.

41
00:01:28.905 --> 00:01:32.685
It actually kills your deliverability if you use any sort

42
00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:34.805
of unsubscribe link or opt out language.

43
00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:37.485
So as a general rule, avoid using unsubscribe

44
00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:38.805
links of any kind.

45
00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.405
And if you must add opt out language,

46
00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:43.445
do it in a really delicate way.

47
00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.405
And I'll give you some examples of what you can use.

48
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.725
Some pro tips for email.

49
00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:48.285
One, don't use anything

50
00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.725
that suggests they can opt out friends, don't email friends

51
00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:52.845
with a way to opt out.

52
00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:54.525
You can take the advice or leave it.

53
00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:56.805
Now, some people in the comments are probably going to say

54
00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:59.565
that you need to add a way to opt out or unsubscribe.

55
00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:02.125
If people wanna opt out, they'll tell you that they want

56
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.405
to be removed and all you have to do is remove them.

57
00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:06.965
In my decade plus of doing cold email,

58
00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:10.485
I haven't seen a single instance where somebody got a fine

59
00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:11.805
for sending a cold email,

60
00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:14.125
even if it violated every CAN spam law.

61
00:02:14.345 --> 00:02:16.525
But I will tell you that using opt-out language

62
00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:17.525
or unsubscribe links

63
00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:20.285
and email one will hurt your cold email results.

64
00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:23.245
And remember, this stuff is hard enough as it is.

65
00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:26.005
You want to give yourself every chance to be successful.

66
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.605
However, if we are using an extended sequence

67
00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:32.245
and we're sending three emails, four emails, five emails,

68
00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.565
you want to make sure to tell them that they can opt out.

69
00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:37.325
And this is how I'll generally present it.

70
00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:38.765
If I'm barking up the wrong tree,

71
00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:40.645
just say away and I'll remove you.

72
00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:42.965
Be careful not to use the word unsubscribe,

73
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:45.165
because again, the ESPs know what that is.

74
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.925
They're gonna detect that it's a cold email

75
00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:48.365
and send you to spam.

76
00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:51.965
But what a lot of people don't realize about emails two

77
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.605
and three is that you're already in the inbox.

78
00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:57.525
If you do email one correctly, you've already made it

79
00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:58.965
through the spam filters, you're

80
00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.565
Already in their primary inbox

81
00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.565
and almost every case, Google

82
00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:05.485
and Microsoft aren't gonna take you out of their inbox

83
00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.565
and put you in spam the third time

84
00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:08.565
that you send them an email.

85
00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:10.405
So once you're in the inbox the first time,

86
00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:11.765
you can send a link.

87
00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:13.645
You can add opt-out language if needed.

88
00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:16.645
That's why instantly has this specific feature,

89
00:03:16.695 --> 00:03:20.085
which is send first email as text only so

90
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:22.845
that you can send other stuff in emails two and three.

91
00:03:22.985 --> 00:03:25.765
So what about sending calendar links or other links?

92
00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.725
Well, generally I like to avoid sending any links in email.

93
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:30.045
One plain text only.

94
00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:32.285
Remember, email one, your goal is to get inside

95
00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:34.645
of their inbox and avoid spam at all costs.

96
00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.485
Now, once you're in the inbox, like I said, emails two

97
00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:39.685
and three also likely to be in the inbox.

98
00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:42.445
So at this point you can consider sending links

99
00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:43.445
after email one.

100
00:03:43.545 --> 00:03:45.965
Now my recommendation is don't hyperlink anything.

101
00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.685
You wanna send highly authoritative links such

102
00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:51.365
as a YouTube link, a Calendly link, a Loom video.

103
00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:54.085
These are links that are gonna establish trust.

104
00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:56.165
People are familiar with those websites

105
00:03:56.225 --> 00:03:58.645
and they know that they're not gonna get a virus

106
00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.205
by clicking on a Calendly link.

107
00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:01.845
And remember that the reputation

108
00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:05.445
of the domain affects the deliverability and warnings.

109
00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:06.725
So if you're a brand new company

110
00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:10.325
and your website is cold, email monsters.com,

111
00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:13.645
if you're sending them a link to your G Ghl calendar

112
00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:16.325
and it's cold email monsters.com/book,

113
00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:19.045
it's gonna have a much higher chance of going to spam.

114
00:04:19.065 --> 00:04:20.685
And it's also gonna have a less of a chance

115
00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:22.445
of getting clicked because people don't trust

116
00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:23.605
that they don't know what it is.

117
00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:25.605
So if you're gonna use links, make sure

118
00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:27.605
that their links people are familiar with

119
00:04:27.665 --> 00:04:30.285
and willing to click on, can you send pictures or videos?

120
00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:32.965
Well, the answer is probably gonna surprise you.

121
00:04:32.965 --> 00:04:36.005
And it's that if you think it'll help get the point across,

122
00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:38.765
demonstrate your offer and improve reply rates,

123
00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:40.525
then go ahead and try it.

124
00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:42.445
Run a split test, just not an email one.

125
00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.685
But the overall recommendation is no, we don't do it,

126
00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:47.205
but I've done it successfully.

127
00:04:47.345 --> 00:04:49.005
For example, have a client

128
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.205
and they sell commercial window

129
00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:53.125
replacement and installation.

130
00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:55.285
Now they identified a problem

131
00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:56.925
that these commercial companies are having

132
00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:58.125
with their existing windows,

133
00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:01.765
and it's really hard to explain with words, really easy

134
00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:03.325
to explain with a picture.

135
00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:06.045
So we used it an email too, and it worked like crazy.

136
00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:07.845
We got a ton of replies from that.

137
00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:10.525
Not all pictures, not all videos are bad.

138
00:05:10.675 --> 00:05:12.045
Just make sure that you're testing them

139
00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:14.285
and make sure that you're not using them in email one.

140
00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:16.925
And if you wanna send a video, make sure that it's a Vimeo

141
00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:18.925
or a Loom or a YouTube.

142
00:05:19.145 --> 00:05:21.205
And a really good way to approach the video

143
00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:22.965
situation if you want to do it in email.

144
00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.765
One is ask them if it's okay to send them a video.

145
00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:28.685
That's a really good CTA 'cause all they have to say is yes.

146
00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:30.325
And then you can send them that video.

147
00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:32.925
Another really important deliverability point,

148
00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:35.765
once they reply, it's no longer a cold email,

149
00:05:35.905 --> 00:05:37.885
you now have an open dialogue with that person.

150
00:05:38.065 --> 00:05:40.885
The ESP sees that you can send them whatever you want.

151
00:05:40.955 --> 00:05:42.525
It's now an ongoing conversation.

152
00:05:42.795 --> 00:05:45.485
This is the same reason you wanna respond from the instantly

153
00:05:45.765 --> 00:05:48.725
uni box and not do mail forwarding to a different mailbox

154
00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:51.205
and then respond from that other mailbox

155
00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:53.645
because it's now no longer a dialogue.

156
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.765
And it's the first time you're sending an email from that

157
00:05:56.765 --> 00:05:57.845
Mailbox to that lead.

158
00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.685
That probably made more sense on the whiteboard earlier.

159
00:05:59.865 --> 00:06:01.685
All right, so what about CAN spam laws?

160
00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:04.765
The CAN SPAM Act is basically a consumer protection act

161
00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:07.405
and it dictates how you can send cold emails.

162
00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:09.245
It's basically saying cold email is legal

163
00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:10.445
as long as you do it this way.

164
00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:12.445
Some basic requirements that are relevant to you,

165
00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.245
and feel free to go watch my video on CAN

166
00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:16.845
SPAM breaking it down in detail.

167
00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:18.605
But I don't think you need to. All you need

168
00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:20.485
to know is they need a way to opt out.

169
00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:21.765
You need a mailing address.

170
00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.205
If they say stop or ask to be removed, you must remove them.

171
00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:27.005
And the most important fact of all,

172
00:06:27.195 --> 00:06:28.445
I've been doing this for over a decade.

173
00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:30.245
I've worked with all of the biggest cold email

174
00:06:30.245 --> 00:06:31.405
names in the business.

175
00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:33.765
I've built hundreds of cold email systems, a lot

176
00:06:33.765 --> 00:06:35.725
of which do not follow those rules

177
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:37.685
and have never heard of a single violation.

178
00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:39.805
I'm gonna about to show you something pretty crazy.

179
00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:41.405
So this is a psycho person.

180
00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:43.925
It's a lawyer that we sent a cold email to,

181
00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:47.165
and this was her reply report of abuse and violations.

182
00:06:47.705 --> 00:06:50.485
She ended up being a lawyer that basically

183
00:06:51.075 --> 00:06:52.965
attacks called Emailers,

184
00:06:53.465 --> 00:06:56.245
and she emailed Google, Microsoft.

185
00:06:56.545 --> 00:07:00.165
She emailed our domain registrar, our do our website host.

186
00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:02.365
Everybody saying, these guys are in violation

187
00:07:02.365 --> 00:07:04.245
of Can Spam Act of 2003.

188
00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:07.325
Shut them down, find them. She emailed every authority.

189
00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:09.125
And I was actually really scared

190
00:07:09.285 --> 00:07:11.245
'cause this happened 2022,

191
00:07:11.565 --> 00:07:12.925
I thought we were gonna get fined.

192
00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:14.525
I thought they were gonna shut down our website.

193
00:07:14.765 --> 00:07:16.085
I was so scared.

194
00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:18.885
After all, she's an attorney, CEO, Institute

195
00:07:18.885 --> 00:07:20.525
for Social Internet Public Policy

196
00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:21.965
that's right on her signature.

197
00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:24.125
So this absolutely terrified me

198
00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:25.325
and I thought this was the end.

199
00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:27.565
We can't send cold emails anymore.

200
00:07:28.065 --> 00:07:30.725
And then we waited and we waited and we waited

201
00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:33.565
and nothing, not an email from Google,

202
00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:35.205
not an email from GoDaddy.

203
00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:36.805
Not a single thing happened.

204
00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:39.205
This is about as close as you could possibly get

205
00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:40.765
to a real infraction.

206
00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:43.685
This is a, an attorney emailing all of the proper people

207
00:07:43.685 --> 00:07:45.525
with the proper evidence and nothing happened.
