**CONTEXT:** This is a transcript of a call where Lead Gen Jay provides strategy and copywriting consulting for a cold email campaign for a ghostwriting agency similar to my business: Million Dollar Author.

WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:03.445
This client does ghost writing services, writes books

2
00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:05.805
for CEOs, coaches, consultants,

3
00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:07.765
and it's kind of an interesting offer

4
00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:09.645
where he doesn't write their book.

5
00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.565
It's like coaching for writing the book.

6
00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:13.405
So that's their lead magnet

7
00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:15.165
and they have a book that will go over everything,

8
00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:16.565
but they do have a team of ghost writers.

9
00:00:16.565 --> 00:00:18.005
They'll do it completely for you.

10
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:20.965
You can be as hands-off or hands-on as you'd

11
00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:21.965
Like. Nice. So

12
00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:22.485
I was actually

13
00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.125
brainstorming some lead magnets for him.

14
00:00:24.355 --> 00:00:26.045
This is a really good use case

15
00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.165
to build like a copywriting lead magnet.

16
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.165
He might need to like pay extra for us to do this.

17
00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:33.885
I wanna build them kind of what we have with our

18
00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:35.845
free article lead magnet.

19
00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:39.925
Basically you answer a few questions about your business,

20
00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:42.085
your expertise, and we'll write the title

21
00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:43.525
and outline for your book.

22
00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:45.005
And I can automate that whole thing.

23
00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:47.045
I think you'll get a ton of yeses with that

24
00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:48.805
and it'll be really easy to, to do.

25
00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:51.365
Uh, but that is something I'd have to like, have to build,

26
00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:53.605
wouldn't take too long, but I think it would make his

27
00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:55.285
campaign unbelievably successful.

28
00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:58.845
Another thing I want to try AI personalization in this one.

29
00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:00.725
Kind of like what I did in my,

30
00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:03.365
I did a a podcast email sequence to try

31
00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:04.525
and get myself booked on shows

32
00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:07.445
and it would basically look at information on the host

33
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.685
and the podcast, which I, I already had

34
00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:12.445
and it would generate an episode title combining their

35
00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.125
podcast information with my field of expertise

36
00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:17.765
and it's most successful campaign that I've run.

37
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.605
So if we can use the AI personalization

38
00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.285
and instantly to generate a book title for them.

39
00:01:24.665 --> 00:01:27.965
My question there is I don't know if we can get

40
00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:30.605
that information about the person in Apollo

41
00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:31.885
to write a book title for them.

42
00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.885
We can probably know a little bit about the business based

43
00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:37.405
on the industry SEO keywords if they have it.

44
00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:39.685
Yeah, keywords. Yeah. So I'd like to try that.

45
00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:43.885
Try to use AI book title and cold email.

46
00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:45.325
All right, so this is what's gonna

47
00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:46.365
take it to like next level.

48
00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:47.645
I think we can, we can do it.

49
00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:48.725
Let's see what we came up with here.

50
00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.085
Getting better at subject lines.

51
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.525
This is good impact with the book Ghost Writer or intro.

52
00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:55.565
See if I can come up with any other subject lines

53
00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:59.125
that we can try and email one if we do that AI book title.

54
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:00.445
All right, those will get opened.

55
00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:01.805
Did you write this book Jay?

56
00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.365
I think. Okay. Need to pair the first lines

57
00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:07.405
with the corresponding subject line.

58
00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:09.605
Of course for this one it would be the Ghost Writer intro.

59
00:02:09.955 --> 00:02:11.565
This one's a little salesy for me.

60
00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:13.445
It's, it's going straight into a pitch.

61
00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:15.605
This is a strategy I like to use sometimes too.

62
00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.685
Instead of starting with, Hey first name,

63
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.565
introducing the first name in the first line instead.

64
00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:22.725
So what do you think about this book title I came

65
00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:23.805
up for you, Sarah.

66
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.325
It's a little pattern interrupt.

67
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:27.125
People are very used to, Hey, first name.

68
00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:28.525
They're not used to it when it doesn't

69
00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:29.645
start with, Hey, first name.

70
00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:32.445
Something to test. See that one will be with the book.

71
00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.365
Title one. Did you write this book?

72
00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.005
I'm gonna, I'm talking to him tonight

73
00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.125
so I'm gonna see if he's okay

74
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:40.285
with me doing this lead magnet for him.

75
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:42.725
Okay. I think it'll be a huge investment for him.

76
00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:44.645
All right, so let's come up with a generalized one.

77
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.045
If we are not doing those.

78
00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:50.725
I heard you were thinking about writing a book.

79
00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:51.965
We don't know if this person

80
00:02:51.965 --> 00:02:53.245
already has a book or not, right?

81
00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.885
True. So I was gonna say you should have a book,

82
00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:56.885
but they might have a book.

83
00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.005
I don't usually like starting with a vague congratulations,

84
00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:02.485
like, congrats on your success at Lea on your

85
00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:03.765
success as CEO.

86
00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:06.125
But in this case it might fluff 'em up

87
00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.805
and encourage them to write a book.

88
00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:10.125
It's been working for one of our other campaigns too.

89
00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:14.285
The fluff, the like title company in the first sentence,

90
00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.565
it makes people feel important, your

91
00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:19.005
Success as you should write a book

92
00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.245
that'll make them feel important.

93
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:23.365
All right. And then when they reply bestseller,

94
00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:25.125
does he want to send a lead magnet? I

95
00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.805
Think we were just gonna have their sales team get from

96
00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:30.245
there, but since there is so many lead magnets, yeah,

97
00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:32.645
especially with the new instantly trigger.

98
00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:34.645
Do I do this again? Strike

99
00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:37.045
through this first email campaign's getting tricky

100
00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:39.085
because we've got three different things I wanna

101
00:03:39.105 --> 00:03:40.205
try within the same one.

102
00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.365
So I make them different colors.

103
00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:45.445
Generic is two to ghost.

104
00:03:45.535 --> 00:03:49.285
Write a bestselling book in less than 30 days.

105
00:03:49.885 --> 00:03:51.965
I think this sounds pricey.

106
00:03:52.615 --> 00:03:56.085
Reply and I'll send over some.

107
00:03:56.385 --> 00:04:00.165
All right, variation one. Now we're doing AI title.

108
00:04:00.645 --> 00:04:03.205
I created this book title for you.

109
00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:06.445
What if I told you we could ghost write

110
00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:11.245
and turn this book into a bestseller in 30 days?

111
00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:13.965
PS, if you hate the title,

112
00:04:14.425 --> 00:04:17.325
you can reply telling me how much you hate it.

113
00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:21.925
This will prompt a reply from people even if they do not

114
00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:24.125
like the AI generated title.

115
00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.925
Alright, so now let's do some copy.

116
00:04:27.265 --> 00:04:29.805
If we are doing the high value lead magnet,

117
00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:32.365
which I think we should do, I hope you don't mind,

118
00:04:32.785 --> 00:04:36.685
but I took, do you feel like you should publish a book?

119
00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.485
I think every executive

120
00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:42.325
of your caliber absolutely should.

121
00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:47.125
Publishing a bestseller has never been more accessible.

122
00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:49.445
Don't like that line. I think every executive

123
00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:52.245
of your caliber needs a best seller.

124
00:04:52.535 --> 00:04:56.605
Would it be all right if I put together a book title

125
00:04:56.985 --> 00:05:00.205
and complete outline for your next best seller,

126
00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:02.205
which was reply best seller?

127
00:05:02.555 --> 00:05:06.325
I'll send that over. Alright, so now we've got a body for

128
00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:08.085
what the lead magnet is going to look like.

129
00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.445
When they reply bestseller, we'll send them the instructions

130
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.525
and link to that lead magnet

131
00:05:13.785 --> 00:05:16.365
and if they say book, then we'll send them some info

132
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.965
and a link to book a call.

133
00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:20.085
Alright, so this is good

134
00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:22.325
for email one email one's always the hardest email.

135
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:25.005
Two simple bump works really well. We can keep that.

136
00:05:25.585 --> 00:05:27.245
Did you get my last email?

137
00:05:27.715 --> 00:05:30.965
This is a great sentence for a email too.

138
00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:33.605
Did you get my last email? Almost everybody opens that.

139
00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:35.085
All right, let's look at email three.

140
00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:37.445
This is also important. Uh, I don't like no time

141
00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.965
because it's kind of deceiving.

142
00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:40.685
Has nothing to do with the offer itself.

143
00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:42.325
This is a little salesy opening up,

144
00:05:42.325 --> 00:05:44.045
but it's email three something.

145
00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:46.805
I wanna try. All right, this is where I'd probably go in

146
00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:50.445
with the lead magnet and I think in this case we need a lead

147
00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:51.845
magnet for email three.

148
00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:53.925
Your book outline is ready.

149
00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:57.685
Can we put your name on this book? That's good.

150
00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.525
That's very good. We've got a team of ghost writers.

151
00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:03.325
Eager is a very sales marketing word.

152
00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:05.405
I don't like the word eager to craft a

153
00:06:05.405 --> 00:06:06.565
compelling story for you.

154
00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:08.565
This is all sales and promotional language,

155
00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:10.245
not conversational language.

156
00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:11.485
That's good for a cold email.

157
00:06:11.485 --> 00:06:15.485
Alright, we have ready to publish a bestseller

158
00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:20.045
but don't have the time to write and promote a book.

159
00:06:20.475 --> 00:06:21.765
I've got you covered.

160
00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:25.765
You're gonna be blown away at how fast

161
00:06:26.225 --> 00:06:28.605
and reasonable this process is.

162
00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:33.605
If it's okay with you, I'd like to send you a book title

163
00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:36.365
and outline that I had in mind for you.

164
00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:39.085
And then my team will finish with call to action.

165
00:06:39.225 --> 00:06:40.445
But this is what we need to do.

166
00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:43.325
This is a couple variations for email three, one

167
00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:46.005
with the ebook lead magnet, one

168
00:06:46.035 --> 00:06:48.005
with the lead magnet from step one.

169
00:06:48.145 --> 00:06:49.325
Now we can test all of these things.

170
00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.765
We've got multiple variations.

171
00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:53.485
I think this is gonna work really well. Uh, the tricky part.

172
00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:55.005
If we can get this AI book title

173
00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:56.285
to work with the right prompt.

174
00:06:56.345 --> 00:06:58.445
And if we can get this lead magnet developed,

175
00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:00.645
I think this is going to be a hole in one.

176
00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:02.525
