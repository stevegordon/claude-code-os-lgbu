**CONTEXT:** This is a transcript of Lead Gen Jay providing strategy and copywriting consulting for a cold email offer similar to my "Leads Every Day/Booked Solid" offer.

00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:03.405
What offer, what copy will work for cold email,

2
00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.965
even if some parts are left out, even if some

3
00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:08.205
of the language isn't perfect.

4
00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.605
Doing this for cold email is the most

5
00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:12.925
important thing you say.

6
00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:14.845
If you say the wrong thing, ask the wrong thing,

7
00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:17.325
give too much information, that person is gone.

8
00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:18.765
So my goal here,

9
00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.525
especially when we're talking about like IT services,

10
00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.565
not all of it is interesting enough to get clicked on,

11
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.045
get responded to book a meeting.

12
00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:29.565
So my goal is, one, make it interesting, find a need,

13
00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.205
a pain point that these

14
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:33.565
decision makers have in their business.

15
00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.645
And then two, offer a carrot.

16
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.685
So something that you can do for them, you know, right away

17
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.485
that's going to make a difference for their business.

18
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.725
So let's walk through some of the copy here

19
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:43.965
and these are just different, uh,

20
00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:45.325
first sentences that I'll, I'll be testing.

21
00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.485
So just the first one, Hey name, I have a, Hey Thomas,

22
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.405
I have a question about your current IT provider

23
00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:52.085
that raises some curiosity.

24
00:00:52.225 --> 00:00:53.125
You know, what, what do they wanna

25
00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:54.085
know about our IT provider?

26
00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:56.205
Or we don't have an IT provider makes them wanna

27
00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:57.245
click and open that email.

28
00:00:57.445 --> 00:00:58.565
I see your companies growing quickly

29
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.725
and I anticipate that your need for IT services

30
00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:02.365
and cybersecurity will also grow.

31
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.885
So we're gonna be filtering based on growth

32
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:05.965
and employee size.

33
00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.245
So this should resonate with most of the decision makers

34
00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:10.445
that we are hitting.

35
00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.165
Now, one of the risks with reaching out to companies

36
00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:16.325
with 200 plus employees is that they already have IT

37
00:01:16.425 --> 00:01:17.725
and cybersecurity services.

38
00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:19.525
So if they do, don't worry.

39
00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:20.485
They'll probably say we're

40
00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:21.565
covered or they just won't answer.

41
00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:23.965
But this is for companies that are growing

42
00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:25.525
and they don't have it

43
00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:28.325
and cybersecurity in place, which will be plenty of them.

44
00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:31.085
Our firm can audit and safeguard your company from online

45
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:32.205
threats in under three months.

46
00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.005
This gets them thinking, oh, what threats are we open to?

47
00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.525
And they can fix it in three months

48
00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:38.565
and they can audit it for us.

49
00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:40.925
Uh, that, that's, that's an interesting offer right there

50
00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:43.245
that I think is gonna be sexy for a cold email

51
00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:44.605
that's actually gonna get some interest.

52
00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:47.005
I'd love to make some suggestions if you're open to it.

53
00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.365
So suggestions is, wow, I should get on a call here,

54
00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:51.725
what they have to say and they have some something

55
00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.885
that they can provide me right now that's going to, to help.

56
00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:56.885
And then, do you already have an IT provider?

57
00:01:57.265 --> 00:02:00.365
So the goal here is to get the answer no. We, we don't.

58
00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.605
And I'm, I'd love to hear what you, your suggestions are,

59
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.285
and that's the answer that I think I'm going

60
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:05.605
to get from this copy.

61
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.925
I know that you're also offering managed services

62
00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.245
and other IT services outside of cybersecurity.

63
00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.805
My thought process is let's bait them with

64
00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:15.005
what their pain point is.

65
00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:18.685
And that's either IT services, so they need help managing,

66
00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:20.365
you know, the, the servers at their company

67
00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.085
or cybersecurity safeguarding from online threats.

68
00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:25.205
So that's the angle that I went with here.

69
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:26.685
I don't wanna say managed services

70
00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.845
'cause it's not a sexy first email.

71
00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:29.845
They don't know who you are

72
00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:30.965
and they've never heard from you before.

73
00:02:31.065 --> 00:02:32.125
Uh, but it's definitely something

74
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.685
that you can sell them once you get

75
00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.005
into a conversation with them.

76
00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:37.405
Uh, this is figure out what their pain point is

77
00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:40.765
and get, get on a call to sell them what they actually need.

78
00:02:40.975 --> 00:02:43.525
Email two is generic, so I didn't include it here.

79
00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:45.965
It's a bump so you haven't responded, blah, blah, blah.

80
00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:49.765
My thought process for email three subject line tests is

81
00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:53.205
going to be your IT infrastructure, cybersecurity protocols

82
00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.325
for company online vulnerability company.

83
00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:56.885
Uh, ooh, what's that? I should open it.

84
00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.765
Is the thought process there. This is where I went.

85
00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:00.165
The more personal angle. I'm Thomas

86
00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:01.565
dod, CEO at slash blue.

87
00:03:01.805 --> 00:03:04.005
I love how the, the spelling too should raise some,

88
00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:06.325
some questions like, ooh, is that how they spell it?

89
00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:07.565
It's interesting. I don't usually see that.

90
00:03:07.565 --> 00:03:08.645
Kinda like the iPhone. Uh,

91
00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:09.965
I did some research into your company

92
00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:12.125
and I believe that I can add 5% in net margin

93
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.245
through our IT strategy.

94
00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:16.045
This is something that I took directly from one

95
00:03:16.045 --> 00:03:18.285
of your comments, so I hope that we can use this

96
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:20.005
and I hope that you can show them

97
00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.085
that in this video and in a call.

98
00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:25.685
One thing that I really want to urge you to do, if possible,

99
00:03:25.825 --> 00:03:29.565
is to offer a free cybersecurity or IT

100
00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:31.605
and audit with an offer like this.

101
00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.645
That's, you know, do you want IT services?

102
00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:35.525
Do you need cybersecurity services?

103
00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:38.525
It can be really beneficial to offer something

104
00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:40.965
that they want or are curious about for free.

105
00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:43.685
A PDF or a video doesn't cut it anymore.

106
00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:45.325
People will need a little bit more than that.

107
00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.605
And I know there's tools that you can do use

108
00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:50.485
to do like a cybersecurity or infrastructure audit.

109
00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:52.085
If that's something we can add, let me know

110
00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:53.885
and I'll get that added into the copy here

111
00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:56.485
and I think it will increase conversions quite a bit.

112
00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:58.885
Anyways, moving back to explain how, here's a quick video.

113
00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:01.245
This will establish some credibility, trust

114
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.445
and do the talking that we cannot do in a cold email.

115
00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.205
If your company is in need of qualified IT professionals

116
00:04:07.265 --> 00:04:09.845
and cybersecurity, then I'd love to share some suggestions

117
00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:11.125
for your current infrastructure.

118
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:12.605
Uh, this is talking to those people

119
00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:15.245
who don't already have professionals in place

120
00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:18.485
and them wanting to know what those suggestions are

121
00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:19.805
for their current infrastructure.

122
00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:21.725
And my guess is that your professionals,

123
00:04:21.725 --> 00:04:23.685
once they get on a sales call, will be able

124
00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:25.525
to ask some questions about their infrastructure

125
00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:26.725
and make some suggestions.

126
00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:29.485
At least I hope they can. This will be hyperlinked to a, to,

127
00:04:29.665 --> 00:04:32.045
to a calendar and I think this will convert really well.

128
00:04:32.325 --> 00:04:34.405
I hope you trust me with the copy here.

129
00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:38.125
If you do wanna make any suggestions to the copy, make sure

130
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:41.005
that before you suggest it to our team to run it

131
00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:44.485
through our sy this mailed.com/spam checker to make sure

132
00:04:44.485 --> 00:04:45.885
that it doesn't raise any red flags.

133
00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:47.845
We do not want to overindulge them

134
00:04:47.845 --> 00:04:49.725
with information in a cold email.

135
00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:52.965
We wanna spark curiosity, get a reply, get a call booked.

136
00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.405
That's when you can overindulge them with information.

137
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.685
Uh, and I think this copy will will serve that purpose.
