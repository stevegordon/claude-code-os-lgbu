1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
So I've been writing cold emails for more than 10 years

2
00:00:02.425 --> 00:00:06.685
and I've wrote cold email sequences to sell cows, gold bars

3
00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:08.405
and even dirty maid services.

4
00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.205
But through trial and error, I've seen hundreds

5
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.805
of campaigns make my clients filthy rich

6
00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:15.285
and hundreds more that were met

7
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:16.645
with nothing but the middle finger.

8
00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:19.845
This is everything I know about cold email copywriting

9
00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:22.125
and what actually works right now.

10
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.805
And if 25-year-old Jay could see the copy

11
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:26.805
that we're sending now, he would literally

12
00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:28.245
squirt soap in his eyeballs.

13
00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.725
This is cold email Copywriting Secrets, how

14
00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:33.125
to write Cold emails that reach the inbox every time

15
00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.885
and actually get positive replies

16
00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:37.045
and to prove to that you're learning from the right person.

17
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:40.005
There's an award right there from instantly saying

18
00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.885
that I'm one of the best at getting positive replies

19
00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:46.685
and here's a couple campaigns from my own workspace all

20
00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:48.725
getting at least 2%.

21
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:51.325
Many of these getting five to 20% reply rates.

22
00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:53.845
I know how to do this. Nobody else in the game is

23
00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:56.845
as consistent at getting reply rates as this guy right here.

24
00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:58.365
Now if you think you know copywriting

25
00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.725
and you're a copywriting pro

26
00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.725
and you're getting all cocky right now, you should know

27
00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:02.845
that this is not normal.

28
00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:06.605
Copywriting using the wrong word doesn't just lose the sale.

29
00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:07.925
It ends you in the spam box.

30
00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:10.125
And unlike copywriting in an email

31
00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:11.605
or copywriting on a landing page,

32
00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.245
your goal really isn't to sell.

33
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.925
Your goal is to identify if your lead has a problem

34
00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:20.165
that you can solve and remember, they don't know you,

35
00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:21.885
they don't trust you and they're

36
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:23.005
not looking for your solution.

37
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:25.205
So you need to be very aware of all of those things

38
00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.085
as you're crafting your copy.

39
00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:29.445
Now, your overall goal here, just think about this

40
00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:30.725
as you're writing any of these emails,

41
00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.245
is it should sound like an email to a friend

42
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:35.965
and not like a sales pitch.

43
00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.285
Let's talk about my signature triple tap.

44
00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:39.685
This is the way that I want you

45
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.245
to think about every cold email that you send.

46
00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:45.245
I want you to split it into three separate pieces,

47
00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.365
three actions that your lead needs to take in order for you

48
00:01:48.365 --> 00:01:49.525
to get a positive reply.

49
00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:51.525
You should split it into these chunks

50
00:01:51.585 --> 00:01:53.045
as you're evaluating writing

51
00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:55.285
and criticizing your cold email copy.

52
00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:56.565
Now there's three actions

53
00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:58.005
that you need your prospect to take.

54
00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.085
The first is they need to open the email to get the open.

55
00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:04.325
This is really done in the preview text of that email.

56
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.285
So let me show you what an email looks like.

57
00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.365
Here's an email in my inbox actually me reporting somebody

58
00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:10.605
for pirating my course.

59
00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.565
So this is an email in my inbox

60
00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:14.165
and as you can see a couple of things here.

61
00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:17.365
You can see the sender name D-M-C-A-F offenses.

62
00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.285
You can see the subject of that email,

63
00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.485
that's the text in bold.

64
00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:23.645
And then you can see the first sentence of this email.

65
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.605
This is all somebody sees

66
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:28.525
before they make the conscious decision to open that email

67
00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:31.805
to report it as spam or to put it in the trash can.

68
00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:34.205
That means you've only got really two things under your

69
00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:35.885
control that are gonna determine whether

70
00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:38.605
or not they open that email, which is the subject line.

71
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.085
And the first sentence, which we can refer to

72
00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:42.125
as the preview text.

73
00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:43.645
This is the preview of the email.

74
00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:45.405
If you wanna improve your open rates, you need

75
00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:46.645
to change your preview text.

76
00:02:46.785 --> 00:02:49.565
Now unfortunately the way cold email is right now,

77
00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:51.525
we're not tracking open rates and

78
00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:54.365
and I recommend that you leave open tracking off.

79
00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:56.285
So it's really hard to tell if you're

80
00:02:56.285 --> 00:02:57.325
getting good open rates.

81
00:02:57.705 --> 00:02:59.765
So we use a proxy for open rates, which

82
00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:00.765
Is the reply rate.

83
00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:02.525
So if we get higher reply rates, we likely

84
00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:05.045
Have high open rates, we Take our best guess at preview

85
00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:06.605
Text that we think is gonna convert

86
00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:09.005
and then we test it against each other in AB tests

87
00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.885
To see which has the higher reply rate.

88
00:03:10.885 --> 00:03:12.845
It has a higher reply rate, it probably has a higher

89
00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:13.845
Open rate. The second action

90
00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:15.765
that your lead must take is they

91
00:03:15.765 --> 00:03:16.925
must read the email.

92
00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:19.485
You'll have only moments, seconds

93
00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.205
to catch their attention and build trust

94
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.285
Before they Trash your email

95
00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.885
or report you as spam if you confuse them.

96
00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:28.165
If you come in too

97
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.765
Hard Selling, if your email is too long,

98
00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:33.525
if it's confusing, if you use absurd guarantees,

99
00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.405
if you're offensive, then chances are they're gonna report

100
00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:38.005
you a spam or trash that email.

101
00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:39.605
It needs to be short and you need

102
00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:42.045
to accomplish a few different things in that second step

103
00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:43.245
with them reading the email.

104
00:03:43.415 --> 00:03:45.245
We're gonna get to these in detail in just a second.

105
00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.805
The third step Is they must take some sort

106
00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:48.885
of action. This is

107
00:03:48.985 --> 00:03:50.445
The CTA and I'm gonna show you how

108
00:03:50.445 --> 00:03:51.725
to optimize your CTA.

109
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:55.645
So by breaking it into these chunks now you can test the

110
00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:57.125
different chunks to see

111
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.325
How it affects your reply rate

112
00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:01.405
And specifically your opportunity rate.

113
00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:03.245
And for those of you that have also seen

114
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:05.725
and love zombieland, I think they call it the double

115
00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:08.445
Tap, but this is the triple tap. Alright, the first tap

116
00:04:08.505 --> 00:04:09.505
Is getting the open. This

117
00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:10.805
all happens in the preview text,

118
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:12.445
Just Like I mentioned, we use

119
00:04:12.495 --> 00:04:13.885
Reply rate as a proxy

120
00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:15.685
For open rate. So I'm gonna show you how to

121
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:18.285
Set this up With the testing so that you know which

122
00:04:18.285 --> 00:04:19.765
Preview Text converts the

123
00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:20.845
best. And you should know that

124
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:22.925
The preview text, Your goal isn't just to get opens.

125
00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.125
I can send you an email and say your house is on fire

126
00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:26.685
Or I've taken your mother.

127
00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:28.805
Chances are you're gonna open that email.

128
00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:30.725
But then once you open it, you're gonna say, Hey,

129
00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:31.765
you wanna buy my thing?

130
00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.365
They're gonna report you a spam

131
00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:34.805
probably a hundred percent of the time.

132
00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.605
So you need to keep that in mind. You need to

133
00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:39.085
Be delicate with what you choose for your preview text.

134
00:04:39.185 --> 00:04:41.485
It can't be too bait and switchy because

135
00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.485
If It is, you're gonna get reported as spam

136
00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:46.005
and that's something you absolutely want to avoid. So it

137
00:04:46.005 --> 00:04:47.005
Should be related to

138
00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:50.885
The content of the email but never signal the sale.

139
00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:52.885
What do I mean by signal the sale

140
00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:55.485
before I open your email, I should not know

141
00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:56.805
that you're about to sell me something.

142
00:04:57.065 --> 00:04:58.605
If I do know that you're about

143
00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:00.365
to sell me something, I immediately trash

144
00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:01.525
It or report It as spam.

145
00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:03.125
'cause I don't wanna be pitched by email.

146
00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:05.445
That doesn't mean cold emails don't work on me. They do.

147
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.365
But the ones that work get the open

148
00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:08.965
first. And for the preview

149
00:05:09.035 --> 00:05:10.245
Text, the goal is

150
00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:12.485
Really for the email to sound like it could be from a

151
00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:13.845
client, it could be from a vendor.

152
00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:15.965
You really don't know until you open the email,

153
00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:17.605
but you have to open the email.

154
00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:20.165
It's also a fun little hack that you should definitely test

155
00:05:20.425 --> 00:05:22.205
and that's questions get opens.

156
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:24.285
Our human nature is to answer questions.

157
00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:25.565
If someone asks you something, you

158
00:05:26.245 --> 00:05:27.685
instinctively want to answer it.

159
00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:30.125
So you can use that principle when you're writing subject

160
00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:32.125
lines and first sentences of your email.

161
00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:35.125
If it asks a question, chances are that person's going

162
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:36.165
to open it out

163
00:05:36.165 --> 00:05:37.805
Of curiosity To respond to it.

164
00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:39.845
It's actually one of the oldest subject lines

165
00:05:39.995 --> 00:05:41.645
ever in the cold email world. It was

166
00:05:41.645 --> 00:05:44.005
Just Question and then your name and a question mark.

167
00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:45.285
So it'd be like Question J

168
00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:48.165
and it got unbelievable open rates.

169
00:05:48.305 --> 00:05:49.565
Now it no longer works for

170
00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:51.925
People who are Used to getting cold emails, but

171
00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:53.485
It's still A pretty good one to test against

172
00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:54.485
because chances are

173
00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:55.405
It could still be Better

174
00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:56.645
than some of the stuff you're testing.

175
00:05:56.785 --> 00:05:58.885
Here's examples of what preview text looks like

176
00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:00.205
and some good examples.

177
00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:03.245
So subject line, if I'm trying to sell cold email services,

178
00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.725
I don't just want to come out

179
00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.045
and say, Hey, you need help with cold email.

180
00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:10.365
It's a question, but you can immediately

181
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:11.485
tell 'em I'm about to sell you something.

182
00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:13.365
So instead you might wanna say,

183
00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:16.605
sending cold emails question mark that makes them think,

184
00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:18.485
Hmm, they could be selling me something.

185
00:06:18.665 --> 00:06:21.925
Or maybe someone at our company is sending cold emails

186
00:06:21.955 --> 00:06:23.205
that I should be aware of.

187
00:06:23.465 --> 00:06:25.805
So that could be coming from a vendor,

188
00:06:26.065 --> 00:06:27.565
it could be coming from a partner

189
00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:30.045
and I'd be curious enough to open that email.

190
00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:31.925
And then the first sentence could be something like,

191
00:06:32.105 --> 00:06:34.205
not sure if you're sending these or not, Jay.

192
00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:37.245
Mind checking again, peaking their curiosity, working

193
00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:39.845
with the subject line to make them think, Hmm,

194
00:06:40.015 --> 00:06:41.205
maybe someone at our company,

195
00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:42.845
maybe it's me sending cold emails.

196
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:44.685
I gotta look into this and see what's happening.

197
00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:46.685
Boom, they open it and now I can try

198
00:06:46.685 --> 00:06:48.005
and get them to take the second action,

199
00:06:48.005 --> 00:06:49.085
which is to read the email.

200
00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:50.285
Another example is this,

201
00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.165
you on Google just came across this on Google.

202
00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:53.925
Can you confirm this is you or not?

203
00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:56.125
This would be for like an SEO agency

204
00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.005
and maybe you pulled their SERP results

205
00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:01.285
and have a a link to their site

206
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.645
and when they open the email it's yeah, I just found you.

207
00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:06.565
It looks like you're ranked a here's your website.

208
00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:09.125
Uh, any interest in like moving on that up that rank,

209
00:07:09.205 --> 00:07:10.445
I can give you some recommendations.

210
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.725
That way we've baited the open. So is this you on Google?

211
00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:15.605
Yeah, hell yeah. I want to open that email.

212
00:07:15.705 --> 00:07:17.725
Now you've got them reading so that they're able

213
00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:19.045
to take action two and three.

214
00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:20.965
Remember they they can't read and they can't

215
00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:22.205
respond if they never open.

216
00:07:22.425 --> 00:07:25.045
So get creative here and make sure that you're not bait

217
00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:26.685
and switching completely different things.

218
00:07:27.025 --> 00:07:29.885
If you're using something like this to get opens,

219
00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:31.845
then just make sure that the content of

220
00:07:31.845 --> 00:07:34.685
that email is related to the subject line.

221
00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:36.645
So if you're selling cold email

222
00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:37.965
services, this is a good one.

223
00:07:37.965 --> 00:07:40.405
If you're selling SEO services, this is a good example,

224
00:07:40.595 --> 00:07:42.725
okay, tap number two is getting them

225
00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:43.925
to actually read the email.

226
00:07:44.275 --> 00:07:45.925
This happens in the email body.

227
00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:47.125
It's what you're actually saying

228
00:07:47.135 --> 00:07:49.165
after that preview text the goal here,

229
00:07:49.275 --> 00:07:51.045
keep it short, keep it punchy.

230
00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:52.685
Use middle school language

231
00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:54.165
and in the body of the email,

232
00:07:54.305 --> 00:07:56.285
you really wanna accomplish two things.

233
00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:58.165
You wanna call out their problem

234
00:07:58.385 --> 00:08:00.445
and how you solve it, the exact mechanism.

235
00:08:00.905 --> 00:08:02.165
And you need to build trust

236
00:08:02.185 --> 00:08:03.925
and credibility in an authentic way

237
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:05.085
that's not braggadocious.

238
00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:08.165
And you can do this in as little as two or three sentences.

239
00:08:08.275 --> 00:08:10.565
Believe me, there's a lot of really creative ways

240
00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:12.725
to do this, but those two things are

241
00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:14.125
by far the most important.

242
00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.285
They need to know why you're emailing them, how you can help

243
00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:17.445
and they need to trust you.

244
00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:19.405
And I'll show you some examples of how you can do this,

245
00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:21.885
but it really comes down to knowing your audience

246
00:08:22.025 --> 00:08:25.045
and then personalizing the problem and the social proof.

247
00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:26.965
And I'll show you what I mean by that as well.

248
00:08:27.305 --> 00:08:30.005
But if you understand your audience now you understand their

249
00:08:30.005 --> 00:08:31.565
pain points, their problems,

250
00:08:31.665 --> 00:08:34.525
and you probably understand the solutions that they've tried

251
00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:35.565
that they're fed up with

252
00:08:35.705 --> 00:08:37.885
or maybe the existing solutions that they're using

253
00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:39.605
to solve a problem that are now outdated,

254
00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:40.885
the better you understand them,

255
00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:44.325
the better you can drive the dagger, which means really kind

256
00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:46.605
of call out their pain point and make them feel it.

257
00:08:46.605 --> 00:08:48.405
So here's some examples of email bodies.

258
00:08:48.705 --> 00:08:51.685
I'm actually running the outbound marketing for lead Gen J

259
00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:53.885
after seeing their pretty crazy success.

260
00:08:54.045 --> 00:08:55.405
I was hoping I could do the same for you.

261
00:08:55.665 --> 00:08:58.005
Here's an article that USA today wrote about my methods.

262
00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:00.645
So social proof there, a well-known competitor

263
00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:02.885
that maybe they're familiar with some credibility

264
00:09:03.225 --> 00:09:05.005
and you're call kind of calling out their problem,

265
00:09:05.005 --> 00:09:06.525
you're at least calling out the solution.

266
00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:08.725
The problem is obvious, needing more leads.

267
00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:11.085
So it doesn't have to be like specific like, oh,

268
00:09:11.085 --> 00:09:13.005
you need more leads, here's how I can help.

269
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:14.125
And here's social proof.

270
00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:16.325
You can get creative with how you present this

271
00:09:16.385 --> 00:09:18.565
and that's where the AB testing really comes into play.

272
00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:21.365
Second part, if you already have more qualified calls than

273
00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:22.565
you can handle, ignore me.

274
00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:24.765
But if you're interested in building an outbound machine,

275
00:09:24.945 --> 00:09:26.405
I'd love to show you the strategy.

276
00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:28.645
So remember, as you're evaluating the body of your email,

277
00:09:28.955 --> 00:09:31.125
does it address their problem and solution

278
00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:34.045
and does it establish some trust and credibility?

279
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:36.645
Now what do I mean by personalizing the trust

280
00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:38.605
and the credibility and the problem solution?

281
00:09:38.755 --> 00:09:41.045
Well, the problem solution's pretty obvious.

282
00:09:41.715 --> 00:09:45.765
It's what specifically do they deal with in their business?

283
00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:47.725
That's an issue. And if you understand your audience,

284
00:09:47.745 --> 00:09:49.285
you understand what they're going

285
00:09:49.285 --> 00:09:51.245
through on a day-to-day basis in their company.

286
00:09:51.665 --> 00:09:53.885
I'm emailing cold email agencies for example.

287
00:09:54.365 --> 00:09:56.085
I know them really well. I know the

288
00:09:56.285 --> 00:09:57.325
software struggles that they have.

289
00:09:57.445 --> 00:09:59.685
I know the infrastructure and deliverability struggles.

290
00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:01.925
I know the problems with retaining clients.

291
00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:04.005
I understand that demographic really, really well.

292
00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:07.685
So I can speak directly to them in a really targeted way.

293
00:10:07.745 --> 00:10:10.485
Now if I'm emailing cold email agencies as an example,

294
00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:12.765
trying to sell them some solution, what kind

295
00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:14.645
of social proof do you think is gonna resonate with them?

296
00:10:15.235 --> 00:10:16.845
It's probably gonna be some

297
00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:19.165
of the biggest cold email agencies that I've helped

298
00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:20.285
and how I've helped them.

299
00:10:20.465 --> 00:10:23.085
So I would name drop those cold email agencies

300
00:10:23.225 --> 00:10:25.565
and the specific results that I got for them

301
00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:28.685
and what they had to say and what that transformation was.

302
00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:30.645
And if they know of that competitor

303
00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:32.005
or of that big name,

304
00:10:32.155 --> 00:10:34.645
then it's gonna go a lot further than some random company

305
00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:36.845
that I've helped that's in a totally separate industry.

306
00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:39.245
Okay, the third tap, getting them to take action,

307
00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:41.485
this is your CTA, your call to action.

308
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:44.365
Your goal here is to get them to reply with a single word.

309
00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:46.725
Don't send any links. Don't try and get them to click

310
00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:48.205
and don't make them have to think.

311
00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:49.805
That word that they should reply

312
00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:53.085
with is usually just gonna be yes or sure or send it.

313
00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.885
The goal is can they read it

314
00:10:54.885 --> 00:10:57.165
and reply with one hand in under a minute?

315
00:10:57.305 --> 00:11:00.045
If they can, it passes the test and it's a good CT.

316
00:11:00.045 --> 00:11:02.525
A quick example, would it be cool if I send over the

317
00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:04.525
strategy person just says yes.

318
00:11:05.035 --> 00:11:06.405
Cool, now you've got a lead

319
00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:07.925
that's raised their hand and said, you know what?

320
00:11:07.945 --> 00:11:09.405
I'm receptive. I'm interested.

321
00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:11.005
I guess I do have this problem

322
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:13.445
and I'm interested in hearing what your solution is.

323
00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.605
That's all your goal is with that cold email.

324
00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:17.445
Get them to raise their hand if you can do that.

325
00:11:17.665 --> 00:11:18.725
The rest of it is just sales.

326
00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:21.565
Alright, some golden rules to follow for your copywriting.

327
00:11:21.585 --> 00:11:24.285
You wanna keep it short, six sentences max.

328
00:11:24.345 --> 00:11:26.325
You wanna keep it to a sixth grade reading level.

329
00:11:26.425 --> 00:11:29.085
If you confuse your prospect, you lose your prospect.

330
00:11:29.265 --> 00:11:32.485
You can use AI to simplify your language as well.

331
00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:34.565
So if you're having a hard time conveying a

332
00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:35.805
point, just use Claude.

333
00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:37.885
Open up Claude, ask it to simplify it.

334
00:11:37.885 --> 00:11:39.845
Sixth grade reading level, let them know

335
00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:41.125
that the writing called email copy

336
00:11:41.145 --> 00:11:42.645
and it'll actually do a really good job.

337
00:11:42.705 --> 00:11:43.925
Now let's talk about tonality.

338
00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:45.845
Sometimes humor works really well.

339
00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.765
Sometimes being really stern and professional works well.

340
00:11:49.115 --> 00:11:52.485
Your tone should match the profile of your ICP.

341
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.765
So if I'm emailing a cold email agency owner, I know what

342
00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:56.925
that person probably looks like.

343
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:59.565
I know their gender, I know their age, I know

344
00:11:59.565 --> 00:12:02.285
where they probably live, probably some 20 something living

345
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.285
in Miami or 30 something living in Miami.

346
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.645
And I know the tone that I should probably take with it.

347
00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:09.045
If I'm too bubbly or feminine with my tonality,

348
00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:10.685
it's probably not gonna go off so well.

349
00:12:10.805 --> 00:12:12.605
I might actually try and use humor with

350
00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:14.085
that person since they're younger,

351
00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:16.525
they're a little bit more carefree, I think it'll work.

352
00:12:16.525 --> 00:12:18.325
Versus if I'm emailing like a fashion

353
00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:19.445
or a cosmetics owner,

354
00:12:19.465 --> 00:12:22.645
that's probably gonna be a more feminine cold email.

355
00:12:23.045 --> 00:12:24.205
I want to be really delicate.

356
00:12:24.285 --> 00:12:26.045
I want to use more feminine language.

357
00:12:26.505 --> 00:12:29.125
And then if you're emailing a car dealership owner, like

358
00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:32.085
that's a fifties to sixties sales guy

359
00:12:32.465 --> 00:12:35.045
and you don't want to be humorous with him, you want to be,

360
00:12:35.065 --> 00:12:37.245
you wanna use sales language speak so

361
00:12:37.245 --> 00:12:38.325
that they can understand you.

362
00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:42.365
And if you tell AI to adjust your tonality to fit a profile,

363
00:12:42.735 --> 00:12:44.125
it'll be able to help you out really well.

364
00:12:44.135 --> 00:12:46.405
Other copywriting dues, low resistance,

365
00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:47.725
CTA, we just talked about that.

366
00:12:48.145 --> 00:12:49.845
You wanna establish credibility.

367
00:12:50.345 --> 00:12:51.525
Now you're probably thinking,

368
00:12:51.815 --> 00:12:53.765
especially if you're just getting started, man,

369
00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:55.485
I don't have any case studies, I don't

370
00:12:55.485 --> 00:12:56.525
have any testimonials.

371
00:12:56.685 --> 00:12:58.765
I haven't really helped anyone in that industry.

372
00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:01.045
There's a lot of other stuff that you can use.

373
00:13:01.305 --> 00:13:03.325
You can use your social media following.

374
00:13:03.585 --> 00:13:06.565
You can drop a YouTube video to something that you've made.

375
00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:09.925
You can use a media coverage that you've received.

376
00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:13.125
So there's lots of ways for you to establish credibility.

377
00:13:13.305 --> 00:13:15.765
But the best thing is a case study from someone in your

378
00:13:16.005 --> 00:13:18.325
industry and ideally a name that they recognize

379
00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:21.485
and it might be worth you doing some free services to get

380
00:13:21.485 --> 00:13:22.605
that anchor case study.

381
00:13:22.945 --> 00:13:25.525
Lastly, make sure that you're specific about the

382
00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:27.005
problem and solution.

383
00:13:27.005 --> 00:13:29.925
Nothing I hate more than seeing a cold email campaign is

384
00:13:29.945 --> 00:13:32.325
Hey, I'll get you a hundred leads in the next 30 days

385
00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:33.765
or you get your money back.

386
00:13:33.835 --> 00:13:35.365
Well, you're not emailing a dummy.

387
00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:38.005
I understand marketing and maybe you can,

388
00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:40.525
but how it's not even worth my time to respond

389
00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:41.925
because if you were a good marketer,

390
00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:43.365
you would tell me your mechanism.

391
00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:45.165
So if you're gonna make a claim like that,

392
00:13:45.315 --> 00:13:46.765
make sure you have a mechanism

393
00:13:46.865 --> 00:13:48.165
and hopefully it's a unique one.

394
00:13:48.165 --> 00:13:49.325
Copywriting don'ts.

395
00:13:49.375 --> 00:13:51.605
Avoid doing these things in your cold email copy.

396
00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:54.925
Don't overpromise by overpromising people see right

397
00:13:54.925 --> 00:13:56.605
through you and you immediately go to spam.

398
00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:59.365
Don't be vague about what you do or how you do it.

399
00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:02.445
If you're making a claim, explain how you get that done.

400
00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:03.845
Don't confuse the lead.

401
00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:06.445
If what you do is complicated, try

402
00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:07.965
and find a way to uncomplicate it.

403
00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:09.405
Have some kind of front end offer

404
00:14:09.505 --> 00:14:11.005
and then do that front end offer so

405
00:14:11.005 --> 00:14:12.005
that you can get them on the phone

406
00:14:12.065 --> 00:14:14.205
and actually explain what it is that you do.

407
00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:16.605
Never bait and switch by bait and switch.

408
00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:19.885
I mean tell them one thing and then get them on a call

409
00:14:19.945 --> 00:14:22.525
and tell them another thing or say something in a subject

410
00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:23.925
line and then in the body

411
00:14:23.925 --> 00:14:25.765
of the email say something totally different.

412
00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:27.765
This is a recipe to go to spam

413
00:14:27.765 --> 00:14:29.365
and you just don't wanna deal with it.

414
00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:32.245
And then always avoid promotional and salesy language.

415
00:14:32.245 --> 00:14:34.405
Alright, let's talk about personalization.

416
00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:36.885
This is using variables in your cold email

417
00:14:36.885 --> 00:14:38.765
that are personalized to that person.

418
00:14:39.035 --> 00:14:42.445
Like your first name using Hey J in a cold email.

419
00:14:42.445 --> 00:14:45.325
That's personalization. My company name, my city.

420
00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:47.325
All of those things are personalization.

421
00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.645
Some of it is good, some of it you should always use.

422
00:14:49.645 --> 00:14:50.765
Some of it you should never use.

423
00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:52.725
And then there's more advanced tactics

424
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:55.845
that we're gonna be going over in the advanced section to

425
00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:57.405
to really take this to the next level.

426
00:14:57.545 --> 00:14:59.925
So a couple notes here. More is not always better.

427
00:15:00.185 --> 00:15:02.365
In fact, the more personalization that you use,

428
00:15:02.545 --> 00:15:05.245
the higher the chances that one of those things is wrong

429
00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:07.325
or signals that it's a cold email.

430
00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:10.205
A perfect example of that is using the company name

431
00:15:10.305 --> 00:15:12.925
and it's got LLC or corp at the end of it.

432
00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:14.925
It's not a conversational way to talk about

433
00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:16.765
that company name or maybe it's in

434
00:15:16.765 --> 00:15:18.005
all caps for whatever reason.

435
00:15:18.225 --> 00:15:20.645
If somebody sees that it's an immediate signal

436
00:15:20.755 --> 00:15:23.085
that they're being cold emailed someone did not write this

437
00:15:23.085 --> 00:15:24.925
email directly to them and it will kill

438
00:15:24.955 --> 00:15:26.045
your campaign results.

439
00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:29.085
Another one, personalization you should always use is the

440
00:15:29.085 --> 00:15:31.485
first name tried and true works like crazy.

441
00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:33.645
And the rest of it you can experiment with.

442
00:15:33.645 --> 00:15:35.965
Definitely a word of caution against using company

443
00:15:35.965 --> 00:15:37.165
names and locations.

444
00:15:37.405 --> 00:15:39.285
'cause these can make it sound like a cold email

445
00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:40.845
and the locations are often wrong

446
00:15:41.105 --> 00:15:42.245
and it doesn't, doesn't sound normal.

447
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:44.125
People don't usually say the location

448
00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:47.285
for the person they're emailing and be very, very careful.

449
00:15:47.665 --> 00:15:50.085
AI personalization can kill your campaigns

450
00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:52.325
and make people really mean if you do it wrong.

451
00:15:52.385 --> 00:15:54.245
And most people do it wrong.

452
00:15:54.405 --> 00:15:57.925
I would say for 95% of the people using AI personalization,

453
00:15:58.235 --> 00:15:59.725
it's hurting you rather than helping

454
00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:00.925
you a little bit later on.

455
00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:02.205
I'm gonna show you the right way to do it.

456
00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:03.725
Let's talk about spend tax briefly.

457
00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:07.285
This is a formatting that randomly shuffles words

458
00:16:07.305 --> 00:16:08.685
and phrases in every email.

459
00:16:08.985 --> 00:16:10.965
It is now mandatory. This is not optional.

460
00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:13.405
If you're sending cold emails, you must have spin tax

461
00:16:13.745 --> 00:16:16.445
and there's really no excuse not to at this point.

462
00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.365
Spin tax improves deliverability

463
00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:20.405
because these email service providers are looking

464
00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:23.285
for repeat phrases and repeat emails

465
00:16:23.465 --> 00:16:25.605
and then if it sees them, it knows it's a cold email

466
00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:26.685
and it blocks that copy.

467
00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.765
So the more spintax you have, the better.

468
00:16:28.825 --> 00:16:31.285
And it prevents the ESPs from flagging your copy.

469
00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:32.725
So let's actually go into instantly

470
00:16:32.725 --> 00:16:34.085
and show you what Spintax is

471
00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:35.885
and then I'm gonna show you how to generate it easily

472
00:16:35.985 --> 00:16:38.565
so you don't have to worry or even think about about how

473
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.965
to do it or programming in this language.

474
00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:43.565
Let's go into instantly ai.

475
00:16:43.665 --> 00:16:46.485
I'm gonna open up one of my campaigns. Sequences.

476
00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:49.685
So the spin tax here is what you see here

477
00:16:49.685 --> 00:16:50.885
between these brackets.

478
00:16:51.145 --> 00:16:52.445
Now this might look complicated

479
00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:54.565
and like I don't know what this is or how to do it.

480
00:16:54.715 --> 00:16:56.565
Good news is you don't really need to know how to do it.

481
00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:58.485
All you need to know is all of the spin tax

482
00:16:58.505 --> 00:17:01.365
for a certain variable are between the brackets.

483
00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:05.285
This is one word that it's going to randomize.

484
00:17:05.285 --> 00:17:07.685
It'll say, hi, hello, or hey at random.

485
00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:10.685
These lines in between words are the separators

486
00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:12.165
between the words you wanna shuffle through.

487
00:17:12.185 --> 00:17:13.885
So if I wanted to write my own spin tax,

488
00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:16.805
I would just do double brackets and I would say random.

489
00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:18.965
And then vertical line.

490
00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:23.085
What's up vertical line, how you doing vertical line?

491
00:17:23.305 --> 00:17:25.445
Or maybe I just want to shuffle through to,

492
00:17:25.745 --> 00:17:27.645
and then I can close that spin tax here.

493
00:17:27.835 --> 00:17:29.645
It's really important that you preview this

494
00:17:29.645 --> 00:17:30.805
so you see what it looks like.

495
00:17:31.085 --> 00:17:33.525
A lot of times you'll screw up the formatting of this

496
00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:34.685
or you'll use words

497
00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:37.725
and phrases that actually don't make sense when they

498
00:17:37.885 --> 00:17:39.045
are combined with one another.

499
00:17:39.505 --> 00:17:41.285
So you need to make sure to preview this.

500
00:17:41.585 --> 00:17:44.325
And this preview shows you that your spin tax is correct

501
00:17:44.325 --> 00:17:45.885
because you don't see any brackets here.

502
00:17:45.885 --> 00:17:47.645
It actually read the spin tax correctly.

503
00:17:47.785 --> 00:17:50.205
Now what you don't see here is all the variations

504
00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:52.165
and possibilities for what could happen.

505
00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:55.085
So what I would recommend you do is copy all

506
00:17:55.085 --> 00:17:57.485
of your spend tax and don't worry in a second I'm gonna show

507
00:17:57.485 --> 00:17:58.645
you how to generate this really easily

508
00:17:58.945 --> 00:18:00.645
and then come into an AI platform

509
00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:05.325
and say, show me all possible variations of this email

510
00:18:05.505 --> 00:18:07.165
and then just copy in that full email.

511
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.045
It understands that it's spend tax

512
00:18:09.105 --> 00:18:11.525
and it's going to show me all the possible variations.

513
00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:14.845
I can't tell you how many times people will use a lot

514
00:18:14.845 --> 00:18:18.565
of spend tax or use AI to generate the spend tax and one

515
00:18:18.565 --> 00:18:20.365
or two of the variations just don't make

516
00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:21.565
sense when combined with each other.

517
00:18:21.785 --> 00:18:24.165
So this will show you what the variations actually look like

518
00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:26.605
and then you can decide whether or not you want to use it.

519
00:18:26.655 --> 00:18:28.125
Let's delete my version here.

520
00:18:28.545 --> 00:18:30.925
I'm gonna save, come into one of these old ones.

521
00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:33.765
Now instantly has built-in tools here

522
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.725
to help you generate spin tax if you don't already have it.

523
00:18:37.025 --> 00:18:39.685
So if you come out down to AI tools at the bottom here,

524
00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:41.885
they've got a couple really helpful copywriting tools.

525
00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:43.685
One is the AI spin tax writer.

526
00:18:43.995 --> 00:18:45.405
It's just gonna read your email

527
00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:47.045
and it's gonna generate spin tax

528
00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:48.245
based on what you put in there.

529
00:18:48.705 --> 00:18:51.405
Now just note, this is their AI prompt.

530
00:18:51.745 --> 00:18:54.805
You can do this yourself in chat, GPT or Claude.

531
00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:57.805
This is just trusting that they have the right answer,

532
00:18:57.805 --> 00:18:58.885
they have the right AI prompt

533
00:18:58.885 --> 00:18:59.965
and it's gonna give you good results.

534
00:19:00.225 --> 00:19:04.165
The problem is some of these don't sound correct,

535
00:19:04.535 --> 00:19:06.325
maybe this one does, but you really have

536
00:19:06.325 --> 00:19:08.525
to check all the variations to make sure

537
00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:11.045
that they chose good words and phrases.

538
00:19:11.265 --> 00:19:13.685
The other thing you have to be careful about is whether it

539
00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:16.165
chose words that could be flagged as spam.

540
00:19:16.225 --> 00:19:17.765
So when you're writing your cold email copy,

541
00:19:17.785 --> 00:19:19.685
you wanna avoid using certain words.

542
00:19:19.695 --> 00:19:21.085
We're gonna talk about that in a second.

543
00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:24.485
But if I come into AI tools, you also wanna make sure

544
00:19:24.595 --> 00:19:28.365
that their spin tax generator isn't generating words

545
00:19:28.365 --> 00:19:29.805
that could be flagged as spam.

546
00:19:30.065 --> 00:19:32.445
So they've got a really good spam words checker tool.

547
00:19:32.445 --> 00:19:33.845
Definitely recommend that you use that

548
00:19:33.945 --> 00:19:35.645
and within that tool you can highlight

549
00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:38.565
and replace the words that could be flagged as spam.

550
00:19:38.755 --> 00:19:41.045
They make it really simple to to write copy

551
00:19:41.105 --> 00:19:42.485
and make sure that your copy is good.

552
00:19:42.635 --> 00:19:43.885
From within this platform,

553
00:19:43.995 --> 00:19:46.645
what I would not do is use their AI sequence writer.

554
00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:47.845
It never gives you good results.

555
00:19:48.025 --> 00:19:50.445
You can use it as an experiment and split test against it.

556
00:19:50.595 --> 00:19:52.125
Sure, but don't rely on it.

557
00:19:52.325 --> 00:19:54.685
I also have a Spintax GPT that I've designed.

558
00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:56.765
It's got my prompts, it's got my list of words

559
00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:58.085
and phrases to avoid.
