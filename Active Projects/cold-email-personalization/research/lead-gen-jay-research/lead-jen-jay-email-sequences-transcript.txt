1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.885
So let's chat about cold email sequences.

2
00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.685
This is the series of emails that you want your prospect

3
00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:06.845
to receive over the course of several days.

4
00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:09.125
Couple of overview notes before we really go deep.

5
00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:11.925
The shorter the sequence, the more leads you can reach.

6
00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.405
If the sequence is longer, it ends up emailing less people,

7
00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:18.485
but more often if the sequence is shorter, you're able

8
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.245
to reach out to more people over a shorter period of time.

9
00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:24.125
So what does that mean? If you've got a giant total

10
00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.645
addressable market, you've got millions of people

11
00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:29.325
that you can reach out to, you might want to reach out

12
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:31.565
to more people over a short period of time,

13
00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:33.045
you'll generate more leads that way.

14
00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:35.405
Shoot more arrows. More likely than not one

15
00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:38.085
of those people is going to be a better fit rather than

16
00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.525
emailing the same person who's probably not a good fit

17
00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:42.445
'cause they didn't answer your first email a

18
00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:43.645
second and a third time.

19
00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:46.125
Important to note that email one is almost always

20
00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:47.325
the best performing email.

21
00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.125
Not always, but usually. And the more emails you send,

22
00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:52.645
the higher the likelihood that they're going to report you

23
00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:55.285
as spam, which is why now we typically stop

24
00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:57.565
after a three email sequence Max.

25
00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:00.525
Last bullet point here, test, test, test.

26
00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:03.605
This is really where you want to ab test your butt off

27
00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.605
and you should constantly be running ab tests on all

28
00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:07.685
of the different variations

29
00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:09.085
and ways to present your sequence.

30
00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:11.565
Alright, let's get back to cold email sequences.

31
00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.845
The most common scenario is the three email sequence,

32
00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:16.885
and this is primarily what we're using nowadays.

33
00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:20.485
Email one, we're using the triple tap preview text body

34
00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:22.285
CTA and tests like crazy.

35
00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:23.845
Lots of ab tests and I'll show you

36
00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:24.885
how to do that once we get there.

37
00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:26.485
Email two is a simple nudge

38
00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.005
and I'm gonna show you some examples of that

39
00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:29.605
and you're gonna send it in the same thread

40
00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:31.565
as email one and then email three.

41
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:33.725
You can either send it in the same thread

42
00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:34.805
or a separate thread,

43
00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:36.125
but this is really where you want

44
00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.485
to dump the information on them.

45
00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:40.245
First, two emails, you wanna avoid the dumping email.

46
00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.205
Three dump 'cause they might be skeptical,

47
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:43.565
they might want more information.

48
00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:46.005
Now's your chance. If you have a video explaining your

49
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.205
service, if you've got special features

50
00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:51.205
that you think are valuable, if you've got case study links,

51
00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:54.725
now's the time to drop all of them inside of email.

52
00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:56.685
Three, this is the general structure that I follow.

53
00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:58.565
Obviously what you say in each

54
00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:00.045
of those emails, that's the nuance.

55
00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.365
The nuance is what changes.

56
00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.845
And then you're gonna space them out somewhere between two

57
00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:05.245
and five days per email.

58
00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.965
As a general rule, if you do that, you should be good to go.

59
00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.885
Everything else is nuance and testing.

60
00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.565
There's no right answer for how long a sequence should be.

61
00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:15.485
I would say max three emails you can do as little as one.

62
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.205
Yeah, you can do as little as one email

63
00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:18.245
in an entire sequence.

64
00:02:18.245 --> 00:02:19.725
That way you can just maximize

65
00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:21.165
how many people you're reaching out to.

66
00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:23.845
But I would recommend the minimum two, maximum three.

67
00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:25.085
And here's what one of those email

68
00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:26.485
sequences actually looks like.

69
00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:29.525
We've got email one that's doing exactly what I said.

70
00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.965
We've got email two, which is just a bump.

71
00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:33.125
This is what it actually looks like.

72
00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:34.645
Just touching base here. If you had a chance

73
00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:36.525
to review my last email, let me know.

74
00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:38.645
Or can I pro provide some additional information

75
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.165
and then email three less of a dump here,

76
00:02:41.165 --> 00:02:42.685
but normally I would recommend dumping.

77
00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:45.045
All right, so when should you use the short email sequences?

78
00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:46.485
This is the one to two emails.

79
00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:48.645
You've got a large tam, millions

80
00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:49.845
of people that could be good fits.

81
00:02:49.845 --> 00:02:51.525
You've got access to cheap lead data

82
00:02:51.745 --> 00:02:53.685
and you wanna hit as many people as possible,

83
00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:55.725
which will give you honestly the best shot at

84
00:02:55.725 --> 00:02:56.805
booking the most meetings.

85
00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:59.085
This is good if you have fewer mailboxes,

86
00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:00.685
You're trying to run a lean system.

87
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:02.725
Or if you've got tons of lead data

88
00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:06.005
and you wanna reach more leads, faster extended sequences.

89
00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:08.685
This is the sequences that are four to seven emails.

90
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.245
You should only consider using these if you've got a

91
00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.525
really small tam.

92
00:03:12.705 --> 00:03:14.045
The other scenario where this is kind

93
00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.285
of okay is if you have a lot of social proof

94
00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:18.245
and you've got a lot of lead magnets.

95
00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:19.885
So each email they're receiving,

96
00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.405
they're actually enjoying receiving and they're different

97
00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:23.685
and they're providing some value.

98
00:03:24.225 --> 00:03:25.245
And you have a way

99
00:03:25.245 --> 00:03:27.605
to opt out if you're using extended sequences.

100
00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.885
Each email should have some, some form of new social proof

101
00:03:31.145 --> 00:03:33.045
and some new value or lead magnet.

102
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:35.365
And you should be pulling at different pain levers.

103
00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:40.085
Different pain levers are, you know, money, speed, prestige,

104
00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:42.645
all the different things that could be triggering them

105
00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:43.645
to want to buy your thing.

106
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.845
You should be testing them and see what resonates.

107
00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.925
You can also try and employ different sales strategies

108
00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:50.045
and different emails.

109
00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:54.005
For example, value dropping. Here's why it's so valuable.

110
00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:55.405
And stacking the benefits.

111
00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.325
You can try and resonate with the person you're emailing.

112
00:03:58.635 --> 00:04:00.405
Tell your story how you came up with it.

113
00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:02.245
Maybe they'll find some common ground with you.

114
00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:03.925
You try scarcity. I wouldn't.

115
00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:05.125
But you could say, you know,

116
00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:06.405
I'm only taking a few more clients.

117
00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:08.125
Uh, let me know by tomorrow.

118
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.485
If you want to get on board, it could work.

119
00:04:09.485 --> 00:04:10.645
Depending on who you're emailing,

120
00:04:10.715 --> 00:04:13.405
just make sure if you're using an extended sequence,

121
00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:16.205
they're offering new value with every email.

122
00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:19.005
And make sure to stop the extended sequences.

123
00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.565
If you see spam, go up and reply rates go down.

124
00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:24.365
And remember, you'll monitor that in your deliverability

125
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:25.245
testing automation.
