## Lead 1: Mark Crites

**Company**: Reagan Consulting, Inc.
**Title**: Partner
**Content URL**: https://www.reaganconsulting.com/the-reagan-redzone
**Content Type**: article
**Topic**: consulting services insights
**Specific Insight**: expertise in M&A trends and market benchmarking
**Platform**: recent

### Subject Line
```
Your article on consulting services insights
```

### Email Body
```
We haven't been properly introduced, Mark. I'm Steve, founder of Million Dollar Author. Nice to meet you.

I came across your article on consulting services insights—expertise in M&A trends and market benchmarking. It's clear you have real expertise in this space.

Quick question: Is that content bringing clients to you, or does it vanish into the noise after you hit publish?

I hear this from consultants all the time—great content scattered across platforms that never adds up to anything permanent.

We help experts like you turn that thinking into a book—100% done for you in 90 days, no writing required on your end.

Open to a quick call to see if this fits?

## Lead 2: Jennifer Becker

**Company**: CIO Partners, Inc.
**Title**: Managing Director, Private Equity Practice
**Content URL**: https://nationalcioreview.com/sponsored/reinventing-technology-leadership-for-pe-and-enterprise-success/
**Content Type**: article
**Topic**: technology leadership in private equity
**Specific Insight**: technology leaders must align digital strategies with value creation plans
**Platform**: recent

### Subject Line
```
Loved your take on technology leadership in private equity
```

### Email Body
```
I don't think we've met, Jennifer. My name is Steve Gordon from Million Dollar Author. Pleasure to connect.

I read your article on technology leadership in private equity—technology leaders must align digital strategies with value creation plans. You clearly have a point of view worth paying attention to.

Curious: Does that content actually generate business for you, or does it feel like shouting into the void?

Most consultants I talk to have the same problem—they're creating content, but it's scattered across platforms and doesn't compound into anything lasting.

We help experts like you turn that thinking into a book—done for you in 90 days, without adding "write a book" to your already-full plate.

Worth a quick conversation to see if it makes sense?

## Lead 3: Dave Sobocinski

**Company**: CarterBaldwin Executive Search
**Title**: Partner
**Content URL**: https://carterbaldwin.com/creating-a-work-environment-rich-with-diversity-is-about-more-than-checking-a-box
**Content Type**: article
**Topic**: diversity in executive search
**Specific Insight**: diversity drives business value, not just compliance
**Platform**: recent

### Subject Line
```
Quick question about your recent content
```

### Email Body
```
We've not yet been properly introduced, Dave. I'm Steve from Million Dollar Author. Great to meet you.

I saw your article on diversity in executive search—diversity drives business value, not just compliance. You obviously know your stuff.

Quick question: Is that content generating inbound clients for you, or does it feel like it disappears into the void after you publish?

This is a pattern I see constantly—valuable thinking spread across posts and articles that doesn't build into a real asset.

We help experts like you turn that thinking into a book—completed in 90 days, and you don't have to write a word.

Would it be worth a 15-minute conversation to explore this?

## Notes for Refinement

1. **Specific Insights**: Some insights feel generic (e.g., "expertise in M&A trends and market benchmarking"). May need to refine the content extraction prompt to pull more concrete/quotable points.

2. **Platform Values**: All leads returned "recent" as platform. This is the correct fallback, but worth checking if any content was on recognizable platforms (YouTube, Substack, etc.) that weren't detected.

3. **Content Type Grammar**: "podcast interview" works well in context ("I came across your podcast interview on..."). Confirmed natural.

4. **Subject Line Variety**: Used different subject line variations across leads to test all four options. All read naturally.
