## TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

**For ChatGPT**:

- Ask for specific Reddit threads, forum posts, or LinkedIn examples if output is too generic

**For Claude**:
- Be specific about wanting "actual quotes from business owners" (Claude is good at finding these)
- Ask for "primary sources" (forum posts, reviews) not just "articles about" the vertical

**For Perplexity**:
- Perplexity is excellent at finding and citing sources—great for stat-heavy research
- Request "industry reports, surveys, and data-driven insights"

**For Gemini**:
- Good at finding YouTube videos and podcast content
- Ask specifically for "video and podcast sources where business owners discuss challenges"

**If Output is Too Generic**:
- Add this to your prompt: "Please provide SPECIFIC examples, actual quotes, and concrete data. Avoid generic statements. I need real language that business owners in this vertical use, not AI-generated summaries."
