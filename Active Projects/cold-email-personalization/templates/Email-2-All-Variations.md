All 9 combinations (3 intro × 3 proof):

**3.2**
> Since then, I came across something that made me think of you: Another consultant I work with doubled his keynote fees after his book came out—and stopped getting lowballed on proposals.

**3.3**
> Since then, I came across something that made me think of you: 60% of our clients see ROI before they even publish, just from telling people they're writing a book. We call it the "author effect"—people see you differently.

**3.4**
> Thought you might find this interesting: One of our clients told me he saw a 40% bump in calls, proposals, and signed contracts after publishing—and single new clients worth $300K-$800K.

**4.2**
