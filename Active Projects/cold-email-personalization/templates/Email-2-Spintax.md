# Email 2 - The Follow-Up (Reference + New Context)

**Campaign**: Million Dollar Author - B2B Consultants
**Email Position**: Follow-up (same thread as Email 1)
**Timing**: 2-5 days after Email 1
**Last Updated**: November 2025

---

## Key Strategy: Jay + Sam Hybrid

**Lead Gen Jay**: Keep it short (4-5 sentences), low-friction CTA, same thread
**Sam McKenna**: Reference Email 1 specifically, add NEW value (industry insight), not just "Did you see my email?"

---

## Thread Position

**CRITICAL**: Email 2 is sent as a REPLY to Email 1 (same thread). No new subject line needed.

## Full Email with Spintax

```
{Hey|Hi} {firstName},

{Did you see my email?|Did you catch my note?|Did my last message come through?}

{Since then, I came across something that made me think of you|Thought you might find this interesting|Quick thing that came up}: {One of our clients told me he saw a 40% bump in calls, proposals, and signed contracts after publishing—and single new clients worth $300K-$800K|Another consultant I work with doubled his keynote fees after his book came out—and stopped getting lowballed on proposals|60% of our clients see ROI before they even publish, just from telling people they're writing a book. We call it the "author effect"—people just see you differently when you have a book}.

{Still open to sharing how we help experts like you get there—without adding "write a book" to your plate|If you're curious how we turn existing thinking into a done-for-you book in 90 days, happy to share more|Let me know if you'd like to see how this works for consultants like you}.

{Worth a quick conversation?|Open to a brief chat?|Would a short call make sense?}
```

## Personalization Variables

| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `{firstName}` | Lead data | John |

**Note**: Email 2 uses minimal personalization. The context comes from referencing Email 1, which already contained SMYKM personalization.

## Total Unique Combinations

2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = **486 variations**

## Key Differences from Standard Follow-Up

| Standard Follow-Up (Generic) | This Follow-Up (Open Loop + Value) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "Did you see my last email?" + nothing else | Open loop question + real client results |
| No new value | Adds social proof (40% bump, doubled fees, 60% ROI) |
| Just a bump | Creates new reason to engage |
| Easy to ignore | Question creates mental open loop → prospect scrolls to check Email 1 |

---

## Technical Requirements

1. **Same Thread**: Reply to Email 1, don't start new thread
2. **No Links**: Still no links in Email 2 (per Lead Gen Jay)
3. **Plain Text**: No HTML, images, signatures
4. **Timing**: 2-5 days after Email 1 (3 days optimal)
