## Full Email with Spintax

```
{Hey|Hi} {firstName},

{I've sent you a couple of notes and haven't heard back—figured I'd try one more angle|I wanted to share something before I stop reaching out|One last thought before I leave you alone}.

{Here's something I've noticed working with consultants|Here's what keeps coming up in my conversations with experts like you|There's a pattern I keep seeing}: {Most are invisible to 80% of their potential market. Not because they lack expertise—but because prospects can't see the depth until they're already on a sales call|Your best thinking is probably locked in your head or scattered across posts that disappear after a day. Prospects who would hire you can't find you|You have real expertise, but it's not packaged in a way that travels without you. The market can't see what you actually know}.

{This isn't a marketing problem—it's a visibility problem|The issue isn't your skills—it's that your expertise is invisible|It's not about working harder—it's about being seen by the right people before they ever talk to you}.

{The consultants who've solved this did it by|What I've seen work is|The pattern among experts who've broken through is} {capturing their thinking in something permanent—something that pre-sells prospects before the first conversation|building an authority asset that works when they're not in the room|creating something that makes their expertise visible to that 80% who'd hire them if they knew}.

{That's what we help people do|We help consultants do exactly this}: turn your existing ideas into a done-for-you book in 90 days—{without adding "write a book" to your plate|no writing required on your end|you don't have to write a word}.

{Here's a quick video that explains how it works|I recorded a short video that walks through the process|This video shows how we do it}: https://youtu.be/ggwgYbR0f0M

{If you've ever thought about writing a book but couldn't find the time, this might be worth a look|If a book has been on your "someday" list, this could change that|If you've wondered how consultants publish books without disappearing for a year, this is how}.

{Worth a quick conversation to see if it makes sense for you?|Open to a brief chat to see if this fits?|Would a short call make sense to explore this?}

{If I'm completely off-base here, just reply "pass" and I'll stop reaching out|If this isn't relevant to you, just say "not for me" and I'll leave you alone|If I'm barking up the wrong tree, reply "no thanks" and I'll quit pestering you}.
