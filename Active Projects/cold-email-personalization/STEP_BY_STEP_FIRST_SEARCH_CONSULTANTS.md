---

## Part 3: Set Up Your Search Criteria (20-30 min)

Clay's "Find People" search has multiple filters. We'll fill them out step by step.

### Step 3: Configure Search Filters

**What you'll see**: Find People configuration panel with multiple filter sections

**Official Clay filters available** (per Clay University documentation):
- Job Title
- Keywords (professional descriptions)
- Company Size
- Industry
- Location (regions, countries, cities)
- Seniority Level
- Experience Duration
- And more...

Let's fill them out step by step for consultants:

---

### Step 4: Job Title Filter
1. Look for **"Job Titles"** section in left panel
2. Click the input box
3. Type your target titles, one at a time:
   - Type "Owner" → Press Enter
   - Type "Founder" → Press Enter
   - Type "Principal" → Press Enter
   - Type "Managing Partner" → Press Enter
   - Type "Partner" → Press Enter
   - Type "Managing Director" → Press Enter
   - Type "President" → Press Enter

**What you'll see**: Each title appears as a "tag" or "chip" in the box

**Pro Tip**: Start broad (Owner, Founder) → You can refine later

---

### Step 5: Keywords Filter (Professional Descriptions)
1. Look for **"Keywords"** section (may be labeled "Keywords within professional descriptions")
2. Click the input box
3. Add keywords that appear in consultant profiles:
   - Type "consultant" → Press Enter
   - Type "consulting" → Press Enter
   - Type "advisory" → Press Enter
   - Type "strategy" → Press Enter

**What this does** (per Clay documentation): Searches keywords within professional descriptions/bios

**Why use this**: Narrows results to actual consultants (not just anyone with "Owner" title)

**Clay Tip**: Keywords help filter down to your ideal persona by matching LinkedIn profile content

---

### Step 6: Industry Filter (Optional)
1. Look for **"Industries"** section in left panel
2. Click the dropdown or input box
3. Select industries your consultants typically serve:
   - "Management Consulting"
   - "Marketing and Advertising"
   - "Business Consulting and Services"
   - "Professional Services"

**What you'll see**: Industries appear as tags/chips

**Skip this if**: You want consultants from ALL industries

---

### Step 7: Company Size Filter
1. Look for **"Company Size"** or "# Employees" section
2. Click the dropdown or range selector
3. Select:
   - **Min**: 1 (solo consultants)
   - **Max**: 10 (small firms)

**What this does**: Filters to small consulting firms (your sweet spot)

**Note**: Adjust if you want larger firms (e.g., 1-50 employees)

---

### Step 8: Location Filter
1. Look for **"Location"** section in left panel
2. Click the input box
3. Add locations:
   - **Option A (Broad)**: Type "United States" → Press Enter
   - **Option B (Specific States)**: Type state names (e.g., "New York", "California", "Texas") → Press Enter after each
   - **Option C (Specific Cities)**: Type city names (e.g., "New York, NY", "Los Angeles, CA") → Press Enter after each

**What you'll see**: Locations appear as tags/chips

**Recommendation**: Start with "United States" for first search (broader = more leads)

---

### Step 9: Seniority Level Filter (Optional)
1. Look for **"Seniority Level"** section
2. Click the dropdown
3. Select:
   - ✅ Owner
   - ✅ Partner
   - ✅ C-Level (CEO, CFO, etc.)
   - ✅ VP

**What this does**: Ensures you get decision-makers (not junior staff)

---

### Step 10: Set Result Limit (BEFORE Running Search)
1. Look for **"Limit Results"** parameter in the configuration panel
2. Click the number/input box
3. Type: **150** (good starting point for first search)
4. Press Enter

**Why set limit** (per Clay documentation):
- Controls scope of your query
- Manages credit consumption (each result uses credits)
- Prevents overwhelming results

**150 is recommended because**:
- Not too many (overwhelming, expensive)
- Not too few (enough to test enrichment/personalization)
- Some leads will be invalid → 150 results ≈ 100-120 usable contacts

---

### Step 11: Review Your Filters (Before Running Search)
Look at your configuration panel. You should see:
- ✅ Job Title: Owner, Founder, Principal, Managing Partner, Partner, Managing Director, President
- ✅ Keywords: consultant, consulting, advisory, strategy
- ✅ Company Size: 1-10 employees
- ✅ Location: United States (or your chosen locations)
- ✅ Seniority Level: Owner, Partner, C-Level, VP
- ✅ Limit Results: 150

**Clay may show estimated results** (e.g., "~1,234 people match your criteria")

**If estimate shows too many (1,000+)**:
- Add more filters (narrow industry, specific states)
- Increase keyword specificity
- Reduce company size range

**If estimate shows too few (<100)**:
- Remove some filters (broader job titles, remove keywords)
- Increase company size range
- Broaden location (more states or "United States")

---

## Part 4: Run Your Search (5-10 min)

### Step 12: Preview Results (Optional but Recommended)
1. Look for **"Preview"** or **"Preview People"** button
2. Click to see a sample of results BEFORE running full search
3. **Review the preview**:
   - Do job titles look right?
   - Are these actually consultants?
   - Do companies match expectations?

**Clay Tip** (from documentation): "Preview before importing to verify results match expectations and avoid rework"

**If preview looks good**: Proceed to Step 13
**If preview looks wrong**: Go back and adjust filters, then preview again

---

### Step 13: Run the Search
1. Look for **"Run"**, **"Import"**, or **"Find People"** button in the configuration panel
2. **IMPORTANT**: Clay documentation recommends **"Skip default enrichments"** initially
   - Look for checkbox or toggle: "Skip default enrichments"
   - ✅ Check this box (we'll do enrichment separately in Step 2)
3. Click the **"Run"** or **"Import"** button

**What happens**:
- Clay starts searching (loading spinner or progress bar)
- Results populate in the table (rows appear one by one)
- Takes 1-5 minutes depending on result size

**What you'll see**: Table fills with columns like:
- Name
- Job Title
- Company
- Location
- LinkedIn URL
- Email (often blank initially - enrichment fills this in Step 2)

---

### Step 14: Wait for Search to Complete
1. Watch the progress indicator
2. **When complete**, you'll see:
   - Table filled with up to 150 rows
   - All rows loaded
   - Search status: "Complete"

**What if search returns fewer than 150 results?**
- Clay found fewer matches than your limit → Results are accurate
- Example: Set limit 150, got 87 results → Only 87 consultants matched ALL your criteria
- **This is normal** - it means your filters are working correctly
- **If you want more**: Broaden filters (remove keywords, increase company size, more job titles)

---

## Part 5: Review Your Results (10-15 min)

### Step 14: Scan Your Results
1. Scroll through the table
2. Check if leads look right:
   - **Job Titles**: Are they actually consultants/owners?
   - **Companies**: Small consulting firms (not corporate employees)?
   - **Locations**: Match your targets?

**Quality Check Questions**:
- ❓ Do 80%+ of leads look like your target avatar?
- ❓ Are job titles decision-makers (Owner, Founder, Partner)?
- ❓ Are companies consulting firms (not Fortune 500 employees)?

**If YES**: ✅ Search is good, proceed to enrichment
**If NO**: ❌ Refine filters and re-run search

---

### Step 15: Name Your Table
1. Look for the table name (likely "Untitled" or auto-generated)
2. Click on the table name
3. Type: **"Consultants - First Search - [Today's Date]"**
4. Press Enter

**Why**: Makes it easy to find this search later in your Clay workspace

---

### Step 16: Check for Common Issues

**Issue 1: Too many corporate employees (not consultants)**
- **Fix**: Add keyword filter "consulting" or "consultant"
- **Fix**: Narrow industries → Select "Management Consulting" or "Business Consulting and Services"

**Issue 2: Too many large firm employees (not small firm owners)**
- **Fix**: Reduce company size max (e.g., 1-5 employees instead of 1-10)
- **Fix**: Add keyword "independent" or "boutique"
- **Fix**: Narrow job titles (keep only Owner, Founder, Principal)

**Issue 3: Wrong seniority (managers, not owners)**
- **Fix**: Remove broad job titles (keep only Owner, Founder, Principal, Partner)
- **Fix**: Use seniority filter → Only "Owner" and "Partner" levels

**Issue 4: Locations don't match**
- **Fix**: Check location filter → Verify correct region/country names

**Clay Best Practice** (from documentation): "Iterate and refine filters until satisfied" - it's normal to run multiple preview/refine cycles

---

### Step 17: Save Your Work
**Good news**: Clay auto-saves your table as you work

**Optional backup**:
- Export to CSV (if available in your Clay plan)
- Why: Safety backup in case of technical issues

---

## Part 6: Prepare for Next Step (Enrichment) (5 min)

### Step 17: Identify Leads for Enrichment Testing
1. **Don't enrich all 150 leads yet** (costs credits)
2. Select **10-20 sample leads** for testing:
   - Click checkbox next to 10-20 rows
   - Choose diverse examples (different industries, locations, company sizes)

**Why sample first?**
- Test enrichment quality before spending credits on all 150
- Validate data sources work well
- Adjust enrichment settings if needed

---

### Step 18: Note What Data You Have vs. Need

**Data You Have Now** (from search):
- ✅ Name
- ✅ Job Title
- ✅ Company Name
- ✅ Location
- ✅ LinkedIn URL
- ❓ Email (maybe - often blank)

**Data You'll Need for Personalization** (enrichment will get):
- ❌ Email (if blank) ← CRITICAL
- ❌ Recent LinkedIn activity (posts, comments)
- ❌ Company news/achievements
- ❌ Industry insights
- ❌ Personal interests/background

**Next step (Waterfall Enrichment)**: Fill in missing data for your 10-20 sample leads

---

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### Problem: "No results found"
**Causes**:
- Filters too narrow (too many restrictions)
- Typo in keyword or location
- Unrealistic combination (e.g., "Owner" + "1 employee" + "Fortune 500 company" = contradiction)

**Solutions**:
1. Remove filters one by one (start with keywords)
2. Broaden company size (1-50 instead of 1-10)
3. Remove industry filter (search all industries)
4. Check spelling in location filter

---

### Problem: "Too many results (1,000+)"
**Causes**:
- Filters too broad
- Missing key filters (keywords, company size)

**Solutions**:
1. Add keyword filter: "consulting" or "consultant"
2. Narrow company size: 1-5 employees
3. Add industry filter: "Management Consulting"
4. Narrow location: Specific states instead of "United States"

---

### Problem: "Results include non-consultants"
**Causes**:
- Job titles too broad (e.g., "Manager" includes corporate managers)
- Missing keyword filter

**Solutions**:
1. Add keyword filter: "consultant", "consulting", "advisory"
2. Use only specific job titles: Owner, Founder, Principal (remove "Manager", "Director")
3. Add industry filter: "Management Consulting", "Business Consulting and Services"

---

### Problem: "Results missing email addresses"
**Causes**:
- This is normal! Clay's initial search often doesn't include emails
- Emails come from enrichment (next step)

**Solutions**:
- Don't worry, this is expected
- Waterfall enrichment (next step) will find emails using multiple data sources

---

## Success Criteria Checklist

Before moving to enrichment, verify:
- ✅ **150 leads in table** (or close to it)

## Need Help?

**Common Questions**:

**Q: How many credits did this search use?**
A: Clay search typically uses 1-2 credits per lead found (check Clay's pricing). 150 leads ≈ 150-300 credits.

**Q: Can I re-run this search later?**
A: Yes! Save your filters as a "template" or just duplicate this table and change filters.

**Q: What if I want to search for a different type of consultant?**
A: Duplicate this table (right-click table name → Duplicate) and change filters (e.g., "HR Consultant" instead of "Management Consultant").

**Q: How do I know if my search is good enough?**
A: If 80%+ of leads match your target avatar, you're good! Perfect is the enemy of done.
